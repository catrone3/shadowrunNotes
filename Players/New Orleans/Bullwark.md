#NewOrleans 
Bullwark ran a clinic in downtown New Orleans. He was working on some experimental medicine to extend the lifespan of orcs that a local corp with ties to the humanist group took issue with. The corporation used a legal loophole to seize his assets and had his clinic closed while it was searched for supposedly infringing material. His work was completely original so evidence was instead planted by the corp. This resulted in his total financial ruin and the destruction of his lifeâ€™s work. Bullwark was doing a lot of good in the community with his clinic. Now lacking the resources to provide good care he has taken out a loan from some dangerous people to pursue his passion for helping the sick and injured. Bullwark is looking to get revenge on the runners that planted the evidence, and on the corp itself for stooping to such underhanded means.
