### Backstory
In the heart of the Everglades, where nature weaves its secrets through tangled waterways and ancient magic whispers on the breeze, Travis McGee now lives as an outcast. Once a respected lieutenant commanding a team of anti-smuggling and poaching rangers, he's now known only by his shadow name: Sting. The moniker dances on the lips of those who inhabit the darker corners of this untamed realm. 

Sting moves like a phantom among the reeds and marshes, a bow his constant companion. His weapon sustains him as much as it defends him, a testament to his survival skills. But his alias holds a deeper meaning, a connection to the Sea, his mentor spirit. The Sea is birth and death, serenity and fury, unfathomable and ever-shifting. Sting's name embodies that duality – the sting of a predator and the sting of the ocean's capricious wrath. 

As a shaman, Sting understands the rhythms of magic and nature, drawing power from the spirits that dwell in the depths. The Sea, his guiding spirit, teaches him to respect and harness her power. She gifts him with the ability to heal, protect, and unveil truths hidden beneath the surface. His magic weaves through the Everglades like a whispered incantation, seeking harmony between man and nature. 

Around his neck hangs a necklace adorned with a single shark tooth – a summoning focus. This talisman binds him to the water spirits, resonating with his affinity for the sea. Bull shark, the hunter of the depths, a symbol of his connection to the wild and untamed. Another necklace rests alongside it, bearing an alligator tooth. The alligator, with its regenerative prowess, embodies his role as a healer. The tooth's power is a reminder of the creature's legendary ability to mend its own wounds, a touch of the miraculous in the heart of the swamp. 

Sting's reputation as a shaman and healer spreads through the fringe communities. He offers his services when the credits run thin, using his magic to mend wounds and cure ailments that fester in the wilderness. He navigates the labyrinthine channels of the Everglades, gathering reagents and magical ingredients to trade in the bustling metropolis of greater Miami. A shadow in both worlds, he treads the line between redemption and survival. 

But beneath his solitary existence lies a relentless drive – to redeem himself and uncover the betrayer who cast him into exile. The memory of his fall from grace burns like a beacon, urging him to unveil the traitor's identity and restore his tarnished honor. The Sea, his fickle mentor, whispers hints of guidance, reminding him that like her, redemption requires patience, cunning, and a deep understanding of the ebb and flow of fate. 

In the heart of the Everglades, where nature and magic merge in a symphony of life and power, Sting's journey continues. As he forges his path, he courts the Sea's favor, seeking to mend not only the wounds of others but the scars that mar his own soul.
