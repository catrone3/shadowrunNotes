1Though commonly cagey about her past like most runners what she has let slip and admitted on occasion is that she is a California native who only in the last decade moved to Florida in a effort to get away from the free state and something that happened there. Her distaste of direct authority can be tracked directly to the treatment of metahumans by general Saito and the 'California Protectorates' involvement in metahuman massacres. 

A wizard with machines, specifically craft that lack matrix access or that require use off the grid, she can fix almost anything she can drive. Though she claims she used to pilot a flying boat she has never had the opportunity to put that to the test, but if the flight suit in her closet is anything to go by it was sure as hell one strange seaplane. 

Though an Elf she appears human which comes with both advantages and disadvantages that has gotten her into and out of quite a few scraps that her machines otherwise could not. Always handy with a gun to back up a team or to drive them to and fro, she more recently made her money being a part time coyote carrying cargo into the everglades and back between runs when she can grab them. An avid collector of antiques both practical and useless anyone lucky enough to join her on the beached mega yacht she calls home will be treated to a number of treasures from the past. 

Though she lacks any real magical aptitude she respects the manasphere slightly envious of those that have the ability to use magic but wary of the power and dangers that they bring. She is however a staunch believer in technology and believes deep down that the separation between magic and technology is just a secret waiting to be unlocked and that the future is in hybridization not exclusion, but that's a tale for beers and campfires after a run.

Always willing to help a runner out for beer money and gas, if you cant find her in her yacht she should be somewhere nearby swimming in the still clear waters of the Atlantic ocean catching something to eat or just enjoying time alone in the waters of the Atlantic. Otherwise shes working on some new project somewhere, restoring an old engine, or getting a old console up and running so she can play some 'classic' game she loves to go on an on about.
