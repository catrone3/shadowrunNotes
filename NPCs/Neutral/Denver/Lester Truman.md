The heir and president of Truman Distribution Networks. Lester Truman is an extremely unassuming individual, with a round face and receding hairline that makes people underestimate him. He seems extremely friendly at first and has a talent for remembering people’s names. All of this puts people off-guard for when he strikes. He’s a ruthless businessman who learned everything about business from his father—a famous corporate raider.
