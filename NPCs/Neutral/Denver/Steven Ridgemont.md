Anyone who ever used the Matrix since 2064 owes some of their success to Steven Ridgemont. He’s a brilliant programmer and a bit of a Matrix socialite. There was even a period of time when Ridgemont wanted to be a freelance hacker, but following his first ‘run, he changed his tune and went corporate. He founded FTL Technologies before his friend and partner betrayed him. Now he’s focused on his new company, Warpdrive Systems, and wants to crush FTL under his heel.
