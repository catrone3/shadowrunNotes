Sometimes a guy sees a trideo and decides to adopt the lifestyle they saw. I have no idea what Rhinegold’s real name is, but after he saw Die Nagelring, he didn’t look back. He’s got chainmail and a zweihander sword. He looks like a Teutonic knight, but once you get up close, you’ll see his cyberhand and datajack. Rhinegold is an excellent rigger who works as a smuggler and data courier. He drives a large station wagon, which seems very out of place, but it holds some secrets under the hood that only Rhinegold knows about. He will bargain down his prices if you buy into the “Beer and Glory” imagery that he favors.
