The man masquerading as an Amerindian shaman who hires the runner during Mission 4 is  
an [[../../../AAA Corps/Aztechnology|Aztechnology]] operative. His disguise and the masking on his aura are designed to make them believe he is Guide (a free spirit that used to roam around Denver). This is all a smoke screen to mislead them into thinking they work for the NAN, Ghostwalker, or at least, anyone who is not [[../../../AAA Corps/Aztechnology|Aztechnology]]. 

Indeed, “Masque” is a spy of the AAA. He is a French blood mage working for Dassault who specializes in covert operation. His mastery of the masking metamagic allows him to mask his aura, hiding the stench of blood magic. However, his disguise itself does not rely on magic, but very advanced cosmetics. He speaks fluently, without any accent, in several languages and is an expert at espionage. 

Being a blood mage that committed his fair share of atrocities, especially during the Az-Am war, he is not at all a “nice guy.” 

Without any disguise, Masque is a white male in his late thirties with black hair, an aquiline nose, and small blue eyes. Those three features are always altered with cosmetics when he’s using a disguise. 

In the context of this book, he is to become a powerful (but repulsive) ally. As the runners realize his true nature and uncover the fact he is an operative of [[../../../AAA Corps/Aztechnology|Aztechnology]], they should also discover his goals (stopping [[../../../AAA Corps/MCT|MCT]]) might be aligned with their own.
