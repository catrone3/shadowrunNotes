These days the Cap’n mostly just goes by Kludge, He’s well-known as a curmudgeon all over the shadows of the Matrix, not just in Denver. Now in his mid-fifties Tom Kwan (his real name) was once a child prodigy, finishing a masters in computer science at MIT&M before he turned fifteen. He was recruited by Fuchi before graduation. That didn’t last long, though, and by ’47, the rising star had dug a little too deep into company secrets and had to flee to the shadows. His playful bouncing ball icon and the handle Cap’n Kludge soon became well known around the Matrix. He was brought into the Denver Data Haven by Shiva in ’49 and has been working with the Nexus ever since—in fact, he’s been there longer than anyone else still alive.  

Ever since Ghostwalker destroyed the Alpha Site, Kludge has become slightly paranoid, believing (correctly) that security at the Beta Site won’t stand up to any type of attack. He has set up his own safehouse in the Sunny Spire Condominium Complex complete with a decker cocoon built from a salvaged valkyrie module and an up-armored rigger cocoon with a built-in Fairlight Excalibur, a Vulcan Leigelord RCC and all the adaptations necessary for extended hot-sim VR. Kludge typically spends his days inside his cocoon, working on the Nexus’s connectivity and communications software or jumping into one of the battered anthrodrones he keeps at the Beta Site so he can work on the Nexus hardware without leaving the safety of his cocoon.
