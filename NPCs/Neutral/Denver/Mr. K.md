This male human, task-driven fixer operates as the head of a Grey Cell (p. 39, Collapsing Now). He has a primary team who works with him, but he also reaches out to handle many specific operations. He and his cell are not geographically bound to any single area or region, but are called in to assist other cells when larger and more intensive actions need to take place. He possesses a magical capability stemming from an uncommon nature and extensive studies in most magical fields, including hermetic magic. He has been active in the shadows for more than thirty years and as a guerrilla mercenary in the Russo-Yakut wars before that.
