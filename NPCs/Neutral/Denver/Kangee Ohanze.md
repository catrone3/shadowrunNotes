Now in his sixties, Kangee is old enough to remember when magic was still fairly new to the world. Crow called to him when he was a young man, and shortly after that he joined the Sioux Special Forces as a combat shaman. After decades of service in the military, he was recruited into the covert ops division of the Sioux government. He was assigned to Denver where he took the street name Crow of Shadows. He has spent several years now in Denver building up a network to collect information on Ghostwalkerâ€™s activities for the Sioux government.
