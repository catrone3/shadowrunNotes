Another freelance smuggler in the region, Silver Streak is a cyclops with a reputation for secrecy and hooding. She wears a large red menpo mask, which obscures the bottom part of her face. Sometimes people will refer to her as the Crimson Crusader, or the Phantom. She prefers to run with her BMW motorcycle and a swarm of flying drones, but for big or discreet jobs she has an unmarked white panel van. If she believes your cause is just, she will help you out.
