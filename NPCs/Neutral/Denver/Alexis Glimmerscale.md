A Denver native who used to be a member of the Children of the Dragon, Alexis Glimmerscale is now a member of the board of the Draco Foundation. She has pale skin that seems almost shimmery, but this is an effect achieved with excellent use of makeup rather than anything mystical. She could have been a model in another life but felt called to further metahuman/dragon relations. The story goes that during one of Nadja Daviar’s visits to the Children of the Dragon in Denver, the two struck up an unlikely and close relationship. Following one of Daviar’s extended hiatuses, she nominated Alexis to the board, and the motion passed unanimously.
