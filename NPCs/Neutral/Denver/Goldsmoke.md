Goldsmoke’s commonly used form is a male dwarf, but he’s a drake who has a draconic form he can pull out when he needs it. He dresses well and has expensive tastes, but he can become a blunt instrument when necessary—and he tends to really like it when it’s necessary. Still, he knows the value of a good relationship and will put in the work necessary to maintain one, especially if he thinks the relationship can lead to a good supply of fresh beef.
