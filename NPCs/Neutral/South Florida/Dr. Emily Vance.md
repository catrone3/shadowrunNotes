Description: 
**Background:** Dr. Emilia Vance is a high-ranking research scientist at Ares Macrotechnology, specializing in biotechnology and genetic engineering. She holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and has a reputation for being a brilliant but morally flexible scientist. Dr. Vance was recruited by Ares for her groundbreaking work on synthetic viruses and has been instrumental in developing several of Ares’ most secretive projects.

**Appearance:** Dr. Vance is in her late 30s, with sharp features and intense, observant blue eyes. She typically wears her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun and prefers formal attire, even in the lab—usually seen in a pristine lab coat over a tailored suit. Her appearance is meticulous, reflecting her precise and calculated nature.

**Personality:** Highly intelligent and driven, Dr. Vance is fiercely dedicated to her work, often to the exclusion of ethical considerations. She is pragmatic and direct in her dealings, valuing efficiency and results over personal relationships. However, she’s not without charm, which she uses effectively to negotiate and manipulate when necessary.
