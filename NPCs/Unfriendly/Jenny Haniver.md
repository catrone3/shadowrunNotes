dragon hunting horror that thrives off the eggs of dragons.

Has an artifact that makes her aura appear as a dragon. This artifact has the soul of a dragon that was killed in the 4th age. This soul is why it can not be broken by masking. When the players got the true name of her, It was the true name of the dragon that is trapped in this Artifact. Using the true name of the ring to try and summon her would work only because the magic on the ring surrounds her in the aura thus pulling her as well
