**Nicholas Whitebird** is the translator and voice for the [Great Dragon](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Dragon "Great Dragon") [Ghostwalker](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Ghostwalker "Ghostwalker"). He is a young Amerind [Ork](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Ork "Ork") shaman of some sort (it is rumored he either follows the Wyrm, Dragon, or Eagle totem, but it is not entirely known). He speaks intelligently with a soft voice, a contrast to the commanding nature of his patron dragon. He was presented to Ghostwalker by an individual known as [The Guide](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/The_Guide "The Guide"), and has been at the dragon's side ever since. There were no public records of any kind on him prior to his involvement with Ghostwalker. Allegedly, he was born in June of [2030](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/2030 "2030"), and raised in Boulder. The Guide "found" him and arranged for his training in [2039](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/2039 "2039").
