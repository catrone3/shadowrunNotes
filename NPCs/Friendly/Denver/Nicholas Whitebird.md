#Denver 

**Nicholas Whitebird** is the translator and voice for the [Great Dragon](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Dragon "Great Dragon") [[../../Neutral/Denver/Ghostwalker]]. He is a young Amerind [Ork](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Ork "Ork") shaman of some sort (it is rumored he either follows the Wyrm, Dragon, or Eagle totem, but it is not entirely known). He speaks intelligently with a soft voice, a contrast to the commanding nature of his patron dragon. He was presented to Ghostwalker by an individual known as [The Guide](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/The_Guide "The Guide"), and has been at the dragon's side ever since. There were no public records of any kind on him prior to his involvement with Ghostwalker. Allegedly, he was born in June of [2030](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/2030 "2030"), and raised in Boulder. The Guide "found" him and arranged for his training in [2039](http://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/2039 "2039").

The orkish Voice for Ghostwalker, Nicholas Whitebird can be seen on trideo almost every night. He’s an Amerind ork shaman of some sort. Rumors say that it’s either Wyrm, Dragon, or Eagle, but no one knows for sure. He speaks intelligently, with a soft voice in welcome contrast from his patron and master. He was presented to Ghostwalker by an enigmatic figure known only as Guide and remained at the dragon’s side ever since. Allegedly, he was born in 2030 and raised in Boulder. They say that Guide found him at nine years old and began training him for his future duties.  
> That timeline means this “Guide” knew about Ghostwalker’s impending arrival some twenty-one years in advance.
