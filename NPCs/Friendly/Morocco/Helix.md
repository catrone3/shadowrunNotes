**Affiliations:** Lighthouse Industries (AA corp), Talon of Ghostwalker, reports to Cat McTavish

## Public Persona

Helix presents herself as a confident, high-end fixer with a sharp business sense and a flawless image. She's stylish, tactical, and known for getting results—even if it means risking the lives of the runners she hires.

She uses an indie media company as a cover front for her operations, giving her a reason to move through cities without drawing attention to her real affiliations. In Paris, she's relatively new, but already building a reputation for high-paying, high-risk jobs tied to magical and matrix assets.

- **Known to be ruthless but fair**—pays well, but expects total performance.
- **Reputation among runners:**  
  - Don't cross her.  
  - Rumored to be connected to a Great Dragon (varies by region: Aden, Lofwyr, Ghostwalker).
  - Suspected by many to be more than she seems—possible drake.

## GM Notes (Private)

### Draconic Identity

- **Confirmed Drake** — awakened in the last 20 years.  
- Her true form was caught on camera once during her transformation, but it was never traced back to her identity. Since then, she's become extremely cautious about where and how she uses her draconic powers.
- She uses subtle powers occasionally on runners:  
  - **Dragonspeech**  
  - **Animal Control**  
  - **Influence (critter power)**  
  - **Armor (critter power)**  
- She **never reveals her drake form** in public and ensures no recordings exist when using power in combat. Learned this discipline directly from Cat McTavish.

---

### Affiliations & Directives

- **Works under Cat McTavish**, who is a Talon of Ghostwalker.
- Cat gives her broad autonomy but has assigned her to:
  - Investigate **Matrix developments in Europe**, especially movements by Renraku and MCT.
  - Track and report any **Dis-related activity**.
  - **Acquire a Dis magic battery** if possible, for one of Cat’s researchers.

---

### Personality

- Helix is goal-oriented and pragmatic. She doesn’t let sentimentality or personal grudges interfere with broader strategy.
- **Will let betrayal or failure slide** if it creates new leverage or leads to better outcomes.
- She always **assenses runners she meets**, building a mental database of their auras for future reference.
- Attempts to **kill her** are rare—and she responds with **equal or greater force**, often quietly.

---

### Personal Goals

- While loyal to Cat and Ghostwalker’s broader cause, Helix wants:
  - A **comfortable life** built on autonomy and power.
  - To **protect magical stability** in the world (especially in relation to Dis threats).
  - To **improve treatment of the Awakened in Morocco** over the long term—her true home and soft spot. She approaches this goal slowly and discreetly.

---

### Operational Style

- Meets runners personally **when she funds the job** or needs to evaluate them.
- Uses proxies or lets Johnsons handle it **when someone else is paying**—she takes her cut and watches from a distance.
- Prefers **concise, direct orders** but will flirt or manipulate when it helps her control the room.

## Summary

Helix is a long-game operator. She’s a fixer, a hunter, and a draconic presence quietly guiding the flow of magic, data, and shadow talent in key regions. As the Matrix^3 subplot escalates and Dis influence begins to surface, Helix could become a major player—or a powerful wildcard.
