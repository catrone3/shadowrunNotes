Hiring us to get dirt on Macy Driver. 25,000 nuyen each, for the job. Johnson is part of a group called "People for a safer new orleans" 

People for a Safer New Orleans:
- not connected to Humanis
- a group of national/local corps in the area created it.

the new cadidate pulled out and left new orleans after the video of him ordering a killing came out. 

did the job to get a kid. got 15,000 nuyen each 4 karma. 

Learned that a new candidate joined the running, has ties to Humanis and Mr. Mustard.
