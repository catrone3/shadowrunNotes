Found one of the other people from the cult we took down earlier. The team was looking for the book as it has the other half a spell that can be used to kill a dragon. Once he had the book he was to take it back to his employer Mr.Gonzalas in Tijuana. We have heard his voice through the mind net while doing a mind probe.
