Over the past 2 weeks, 4 different kids have disappeared. The kids have gone to bed and by morning they are missing. They have gone missing over different days.
Thanksgiving is when the place opened and a kid disappeared that night. 

Mrs. David is offering 500,000 total for the job from her side. 
There was a horror in a raindeer, it ended in a girl. Now using opium den to hold it in place while performing a ritual. 

Ended up getting 1 million nuyen for the team instead of 500,000

Total for the four here is 1.75 million
