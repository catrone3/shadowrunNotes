A great open air bar for one to sip on Mojitos. At least once a week you can find [[NPCs/Neutral/South Florida/Chuck Finley|Chuck Finley]] sipping one. Over the years, this place has picked up a reputation of where to go if you need a special kind of help. If you are a new runner, you can probably find some low paying jobs here. Although each of these jobs are for those in need. You don't need to announce yourself as the the bar tenders have a habit of picking out people who are just waiting on a job. If they don't, they talk loud enough for patrons to hear about the need of help while keeping the details out.
