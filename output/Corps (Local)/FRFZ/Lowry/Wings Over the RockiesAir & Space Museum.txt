<p>The Air & Space Museum has a long-standing history for excellence. They proudly display replica and original aircraft from almost every era of flight. Everything from classic propeller planes to modern t-birds and military aircraft of all kinds can be found here. None of it is functional anymore, but if you need a quiet place to have a meet that doesnâ€™t seem super pretentious, this might be your ideal location.</p>
