<p>A man-made mountain that was built in the 1960s, Echo Mountain has changed hands many times. It has the distinction of being the only ski resort in the sprawl that hasn’t been overtaken by nature. The security here is top-notch, with drones flying about to ensure that only authorized skiers are present.</p>

> It’s worth noting that when they talk about a “man-made” mountain, they’re actually saying that they cleared the forest that was present and used the trees to make the slopes taller. It was a travesty to nature, which I believe has directly impacted its ability to remain under a single owner for more than a decade. It seems like bad luck plagues this place, but the current owners seem to think they can change that luck.
