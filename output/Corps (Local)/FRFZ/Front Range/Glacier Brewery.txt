While most of the FRFZ is known for its breweries, none are as storied as the Glacier Brewery. Once owned by any number of corporations, everyone that ever took possession of the company went bankrupt. Now the company is out of business and the factory appears shut down, yet somehow Glacier products keep getting on shelves.
Products: Celedyr Cider, Dunkelzahn Dopplebock, Hestaby Honey Ale, Lofwyr Lager, Sirrurg Stout, and White Wyrm Pale Ale.
