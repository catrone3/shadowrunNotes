If you’re Infected in Denver, you better know about the Meat Market in Aurora. Built into an old mall on the north end, it’s an open secret that the place is run by Tamanous. They cater, literally, to the special dietary needs of the Infected. It’s a great place to find buyers for any fresh “product” you might have available.
