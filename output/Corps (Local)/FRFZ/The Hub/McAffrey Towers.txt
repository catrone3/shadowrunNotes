McAffrey Towers has fallen on hard times. Twenty years ago, the place was the hottest up-and-coming residence in the East Hub. Due to fiscal mismanagement, the place has lost its luster. It’s still a great place to live – it’s just not up-to-date and can’t compete with the other places in the area.
