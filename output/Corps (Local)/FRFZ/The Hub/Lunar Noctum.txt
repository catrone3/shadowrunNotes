It’s a local mage hangout, so I’m not really qualified to talk much about it. I’ll leave the description of the magical things to Bifrost.
Lunar Noctum is shrouded by an anchored Darkness spell. Astral perception is required to be able to navigate the club, which keeps the mundanes away. Once a month, generally the day before the New Moon, the bar shuts down to cover the surfaces with a thin layer of neutralized FAB, so mages can navigate properly. On the New Moon, a huge party draws massive crowds of spirits and mages alike. The club is owned by a dwarf mage named Brandi “Bam Bam” Bautista.
