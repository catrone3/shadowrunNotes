Built in 1910 as part of the Daniels & Fisher department store, the clock tower was, at the time, the tallest building west of the Mississippi river. Since the department storeâ€™s closure, the tower traded ownership multiple times. The top five floors of the clock tower (which include the clock face) are available for rent, even potentially as a very unique residence. The bottom floors have been leased out for decades as a cabaret/bar. The remaining two floors of the building are used as office space by the owners.
