Don't be fooled by its whimsical appearance, for this establishment boasts top-notch security that rivals the best in the sector. Formerly part of the SDF, the highly skilled security personnel undergo annual training, a testament to the management's commitment to maintaining their expertise and ensuring the utmost safety for their guests.

Most of the security here are former Sioux Defense Force, and the management ensures their skills stay sharp by giving them a month each year for training. They also make extensive use of traps and alarms to supplement their staff, allowing them to respond to threats quickly.
