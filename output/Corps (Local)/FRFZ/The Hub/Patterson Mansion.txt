Originally built in 1890 and owned by a Thomas Croke, the mansion was sold in 1893 to Thomas Patterson. During a renovation in the 1970s, vandals roamed across the grounds and moved things. The crew decided to get a couple of guard dogs, but things got decidedly strange the next day, when the dogs were found to have jumped out of a third-story window to their deaths. Since then, the mansion is said to be haunted, and no one wanted to live there. It was converted into a bed and breakfast, capitalizing on its status as a haunted house until the Awakening. That was when the ghosts of the house managed to chase out everyone who was there, and since then they have forcefully resisted any attempts to settle on the ground.
> No one has been able to exorcise the ghosts, and now the property sits empty, staring out at Millionaireâ€™s Row like a skull. The most powerful spirit of the house lives in the basement and takes the form of a little girl named Emma. She takes tremendous offense at the living stepping foot on her property. Somewhat ironically, free spirits are allowed to gather here without interference. There are even reports of spirit-only parties and festivities taking place on the grounds.
