What was once a political arena built for the executives for each sector, Council Hall has been converted into a museum. A grotesque display of Ghostwalkerâ€™s power, the museum essentially taunts each of the former member nations of the FRFZ. Each of the nations that previously had a sector has a dedicated exhibit, with statues and art commemorating their failures as leaders, and exalting Ghostwalker as the savior the Zone needed.
