== Draco Foundation Office ==

===== District: [[Locations/FRFZ/The Hub|The Hub]] =====

#Denver
The Draco Foundation maintains an office in the Hub. Most standard office functions can be performed here. Recruitment is one of the primary functions. Some of the leadership, including Nadja Daviar, can occasionally be found here, using the facility as a remote office. There are unsubstantiated rumors that the Draco Foundation managed to recover powerful artifacts after the fight between Ghostwalker and Harlequin. The fact that the building has a basement protected with very powerful wards hints that these rumors may have basis in truth. The Draco Foundation also runs a homeless outreach program in an annex building. In exchange for a warm meal and bed, they ask that all residents provide news of the streets.
> The primary reason for maintaining this office is to maintain their spy network within the FRFZ. The Draco Foundation also has close ties to the Children of the Dragon through one of their newest board members, Alexis Glimmerscale.
