Located directly across the street from Ghostwalker’s liaison’s office, the Church of the Dragon Reborn was built from a splinter sect of the Children of the Dragon. With the resurgence in membership since Ghostwalker’s Reclamation, the church began construction on other locations throughout the FRFZ. Often, one can find Joshua Morningstar leading prayer services in the shadow of Ghostwalker’s liaison’s office.
> Joshua Morningstar has more than a few skeletons in his closet. For one thing, he never existed prior to 2061. Rumors have it that he’s actually a drake of Ghostwalker’s, but none have ever seen him shift into draconic form, and his aura has a lot of powerful masking magic.
