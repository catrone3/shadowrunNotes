The Stouffer Concourse Is the third Incarnation o f an airport hotel that dates back to the latter half of the last century. It burned down and was rebuilt In 2003, and again In 2034. Each time, layers of old-time elegance got stripped away, leaving the present hotel nothing more than a roof over the heads of business travelers and others making a short layover at Stapleton
