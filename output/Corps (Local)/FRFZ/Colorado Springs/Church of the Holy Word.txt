<p>Despite Ghostwalker’s Reclamation, the Church of the Holy Word continues its mission of proselytizing its unique brand of Christianity. The church represents a well-funded and well-organized front, with a militant arm called the Followers of the Holy Sword. Rumor has it that they have connections to the Human Nation.</p>

> The Followers of the Holy Sword is just an extension of yet another hate group. It shocks me that Ghostwalker didn’t do anything about these guys when he was kicking out all the other folks. Frankly, it pisses me off. The Followers have been ramping up attacks in the area too. They’re cowards, to a man, but they’re well-armed and dangerous.
