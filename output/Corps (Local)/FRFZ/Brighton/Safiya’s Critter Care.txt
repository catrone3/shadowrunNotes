Just your average, run-of-the-mill pet clinic catering to a rural community. Or it would be, if not for the fact that Safiya’s a gifted geneticist. She can actually whip up some chimeric animals in this clinic, which makes her a tidy sum on the black market. If you need some patching up while you’re in Brighton, Safiya’s a good person to know. In addition to her pet clinic, she operates as a rural version of a street doc.
