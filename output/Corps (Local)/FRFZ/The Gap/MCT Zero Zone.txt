Very little is known about this location. The only thing known for sure is that this is one of the infamous [[AAA Corps/MCT|MCT]] Zero Zones. The building itself is described as short, which implies that anything valuable is stored underground. But good luck getting in there to find out what [[AAA Corps/MCT|MCT]] is storing.
