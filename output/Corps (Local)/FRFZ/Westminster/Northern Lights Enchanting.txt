Northern Lights is run by a very large man with one eye who I swear thinks heâ€™s the embodiment of Odin. He goes by Northman, and he even has a raven familiar named Huginn. He claims the other one, Muninn, is away and up to no good. Despite the fact that Northman follows the Norse tradition a bit too literally, his work is absolutely top-notch. He can enchant nearly anything, but he excels at rune work and qi foci.
