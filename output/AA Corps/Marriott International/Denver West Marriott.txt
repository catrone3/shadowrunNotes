The Denver Marriott Wet Is owned by Marriott Hotels of Cheyenne, a wholly owned subsidiary of Marriott Hotels international--a not-s-subtle means of circumventing some of Ute's more arcane corporate-ownership laws. No matter whose name's on the data work, however, this is a Marriott. And that means god service, bland decor, and relatively high prices. Note that this place is in the 'burb of Golden.
