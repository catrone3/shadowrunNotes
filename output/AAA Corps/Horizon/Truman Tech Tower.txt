When [[AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] gained control of the Truman Distribution Networks, they also gained possession of the Truman Tech Tower. [[AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] has given over some of the building to Pathfinder Multimedia, but most of the building is operated by [[AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] subsidiary Singularity.
> The merger between TDN and [[AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] hasn’t gone as smoothly as [[AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] would like. There are still elements of TDN that think that they should have gone private instead of being bought by [[AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]], and they’re trying to leverage the merger as another opportunity to go private again. [[AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] will win in the end, but the question remains about what the leftovers will be.
