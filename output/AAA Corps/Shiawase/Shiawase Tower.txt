This building is less of a plaza and more of a tower. For this reason, the building while still owned by [[AAA Corps/Shiawase|Shiawase]], is no longer called [[AAA Corps/Shiawase|Shiawase]] Plaza. This is now called the [[AAA Corps/Shiawase|Shiawase]] Tower. The name [[AAA Corps/Shiawase|Shiawase]] Plaza has been given to an actual plaza of buildings in Thornton
