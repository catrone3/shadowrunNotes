#Denver
This is yet another tech company that at one point found its way into NeoNET’s hands. Now it’s in the hands of [[AAA Corps/Spinrad Global|Spinrad Global]], but the future is extremely uncertain. Novatech made a bid following Ghostwalker’s Reclamation to provide services for the new public grid. That bid failed and made their dissolution a near certainty. Even though they are presenting a brave public face, the staff is jumping ship for other companies, such as Warpdrive.
