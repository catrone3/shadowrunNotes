== Ming Solutions Office ==

===== District: [[Locations/FRFZ/Lowry|Lowry]] =====

The local office of Ming Solutions, a subsidiary of [[AAA Corps/Wuxing|Wuxing]]. The researchers and geomancers in this office were responsible for coordinating the construction of [[AAA Corps/Wuxing|Wuxing]] Cherry Park. Now that Cherry Park has been built, there was a concern that Ming would be moved to that new facility. However, it seems that [[AAA Corps/Wuxing|Wuxing]] likes to keep some influence over Chinatown and will not be moving Ming Solutions any time soon.
