[[Ares|Ares]] has a lot of manufacturing facilities in the region. Arthur Vogel wanted a way to make [[Ares|Ares]] really stand out in the FRFZ though, so he ordered construction of this narrow fifty-story skyscraper. Shortly after, [[Ares|Ares]] Consumer Products division moved its headquarters into the Spire. Because Aztechnology was ousted from the region, [[Ares|Ares]] Consumer Products decided to try to use Denver as a test bed for products from all the various nations. This strategy was working well until Ghostwalkerâ€™s Reclamation. The offices for [[Ares|Ares]] Consumer Products and other divisions are all above ground, and occasionally Vogel himself visited. The R&D labs are all below ground. [[Ares|Ares]] proudly recruits dwarves to work in the Spire, and they boast that they have more dwarfs on their payroll than any other business in the FRFZ.
