Once a public school, McAuliffe is now wholly owned by [[Ares|Ares]] Macrotechnology. [[Ares|Ares]] brings in faculty from around the world to teach their students the latest in self-defense, military theory, and business strategy. Itâ€™s a combination of military education and business school, which pretty much describes [[Ares|Ares]] to a T. Graduates here are usually fast-tracked into management positions within [[Ares|Ares]].
