The Blackhawk Resort and Casino siphons money from tourists with an ease and grace that one is hard-pressed to find outside of Las Vegas. But unlike Las Vegas, the Blackhawk can offer views of the Rocky Mountains from their wraparound heated infinity edge pool. The ten-story resort has more than two hundred rooms that vary in accommodation to suit every budget.
