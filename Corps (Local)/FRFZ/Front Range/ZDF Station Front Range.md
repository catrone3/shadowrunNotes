Normally I wouldn’t cover a [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] station in this sort of thing—it’s safe to say that most of them are pretty similar. However, this one is unique and therefore deserving of its own entry. The extremely mountainous terrain of the Front Range district demands that [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] officers are trained in survival techniques their more urban brethren are not. Additionally, the Front Range district has a larger-than-normal presence of drone patrol forces, and they are trained in border security and counter-smuggling operations.  

> They also make extensive use of drones as repeaters to keep signals strong. If you can find which drone is being used as a repeater and take it out, you can effectively eliminate the entire fleet.
