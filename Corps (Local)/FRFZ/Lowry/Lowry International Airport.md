Located near the site of the former Lowry Air Force Base, Lowry International is a small airport that, due to the small runway, is only rated to handle semi-ballistic, suborbital, and HSCT flights. There are also facilities for VTOL aircraft, such as helicopters and skycabs. Rumors say that there were missile silos buried under the facilities, along with a command-and-control bunker. No one has found evidence of these things, but the rumors persist.
