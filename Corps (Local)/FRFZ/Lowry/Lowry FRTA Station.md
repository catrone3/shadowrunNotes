#Denver 
The FRTA manages this station as a central hub for changing trains and routes. Its proximity to Lowry International Airport and The Hub makes it the busiest station outside of Union Station. This is also where one can board a train going to the UCAS sector of Front Range or to one of the CAS sectors.  
  
Getting onto an international train requires the same security screening procedures found at airports and along highways. However, changing trains for domestic travel is a simple procedure that rarely involves any interaction at all.
