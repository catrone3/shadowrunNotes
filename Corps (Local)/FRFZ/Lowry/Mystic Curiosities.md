A good talismonger is half crack researcher, half con man. It’s tough to make a good living simply with quality telesma—the competition for such goods is high, and the supply is tight. If a talismonger wants to make a living, they have to be willing to get people to overpay for some cheap crap.  

Zhang Wong, proprietor of Mystic Curiosities in Chinatown, has sold share of cheap crap in his time. Sometimes people use that to dismiss him, to label him as ignorant or a cheat. Ignoring him, though, means missing out on his considerable body of knowledge—and on the good stuff he occasionally has on display in his shop.  

The best way to get the good stuff when it goes on sale is not to just show up, browse, and hope. Cultivate Zhang, ask him advice, and pay him when he tells you something useful. Build up that relationship, show him he’s valued, and eventually you’ll get a call from him telling you that he’s got something in stock you may be interested in taking a look at.  

> Zhang wants to get on the research of the various properties of Sangre del Diablo sap, but he doesn’t have a good pipeline into the south. If you can help him build one, you’ll get on his “valued customer” list. And that’s a good list to be on.
