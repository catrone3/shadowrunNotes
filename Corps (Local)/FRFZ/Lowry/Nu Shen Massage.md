A bunraku parlor that caters to the nearby corporate types from Centennial. Nu Shen is run by an elf (maybe?) named Da-xia “Daisy” Wu who keeps slotting herself into different bodies. One day she might be in the body of a human man, or another day she might be a troll woman. 

> I’m of the opinion that Daisy is a very dangerous artificial intelligence who just hops into the bodies of puppets when needed. The callous nature of an AI like this is only part of why it’s dangerous. It clearly revels in the suffering of others and takes some sort of pleasure in seeing humans damage each other. I can’t even begin to fathom what would motivate an AI to be so hateful.
