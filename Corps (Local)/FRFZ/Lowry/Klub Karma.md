Formerly operated by the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/White Lotus|White Lotus]] triad, Klub Karma is currently run by the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Casquilho family|Casquilho family]]. While talking business is allowed there, violence is not. There are private rooms up on the second floor for discreet meetings. Getting access to one of the private rooms requires talking with the manager and convincing them to let you in.  

> The [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/White Lotus|White Lotus]] want nothing more than to take back Klub Karma for themselves. They see the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Casquilho family|Casquilho Family]] as interlopers with a temporary lease on things. There will be a reckoning.
