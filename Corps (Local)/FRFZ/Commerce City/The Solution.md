A bar that sits near the Krupp Chemicals Refinery. The story goes that it was built by a chemist who used to work for Krupp Chemicals who had the idea that it’d be a fancy bar with lots of chemistry puns. Unfortunately, no one wanted a bar like that, and he went deep into debt before killing himself. The current owners joke that he found his solution in the end. Now it’s your basic blue-collar bar where you can find locals drowning their sorrows. It’s a great place to get info if you can ingratiate yourself. Don’t go flaunting money or influence, though—those don’t work on people like this. Make them think you’re a roughneck, and you’re in.
