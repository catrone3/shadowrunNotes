The other side of the FTL coin. The important thing to know about Warpdrive Systems is that their CEO, Steven Ridgemont, is a very well-connected dwarf. He’s got money coming in from somewhere that I can’t account for, as he’s rolling with deeper pockets than he should have. What’s he doing with all that money? Hiring shadowrunners to tear down his competition.
