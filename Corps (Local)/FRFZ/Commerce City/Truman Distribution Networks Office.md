Truman Distribution Networks (TDN) is the largest media outlet in the region. They got to be big enough to attract the attention of [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] and [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]]. [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] bought them out and traded them to [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] in exchange for [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]]’s PR work on their Excalibur fiasco. There was some debate about integrating TDN into [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]]’s office in Boulder, but they decided that this facility still had  enough value to keep it active.
