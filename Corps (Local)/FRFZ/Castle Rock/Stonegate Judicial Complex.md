The Stonegate Judicial Complex is a large prison that also houses a small judicial wing for trials. The homeless from Englewood and Castle Rock sometimes will try to get arrested during the winter for vagrancy. Itâ€™s better to be in a [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] prison than on the streets during the harsh winters.
