#Denver 
Sedalia is a relatively small international airport, built by the PCC after the Denver Treaty to serve as the sector airport. It is a modern facility that was updated just before the Olympics with the latest security. But despite its modernity, it is relatively under-used, even during the Olympics. It often serves as the secondary airport for most flights, because it almost always has at least one runway free and has the most modern emergency response and repair teams of any airport in the sprawl. It is the other major airport that has semi-regular boost suborbital flights, though most of these are PCC-sponsored flights to their own microgravity production facilities.

Unfortunately, it’s relatively small and can’t handle intercontinental flights. As a result, the airport is actively trying to buy up the land around itself to expand. The Ghostwalker administration has prevented these purchases, though, which led to litigation against Ghostwalker by the Sedalia airport owners. I think they’re just hoping for a settlement, since there’s no chance Ghostwalker  
will ever show up in court for something like this. 

It’s a great opportunity for someone to pull a con here. Just present falsified papers that indicate that the land is available for sale, take the money, and run. It’s the old “Brooklyn Bridge” scam.
