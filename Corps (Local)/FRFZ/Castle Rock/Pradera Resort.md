Craving a western-themed break from the hustle and bustle of the city? Come to Pradera. The massive 250-acre resort includes three golf courses, two horse tracks, secluded wooded areas, and rentals for log cabins. 

Sorry for the pamphlet spiel, but that’s what Pradera is in a nutshell. It’s a western-themed resort for rich slots who have more money than sense. If you think this would make a mark easy to take while they’re away from their corporate bosses, think again. Pradera boasts some of the best security and privacy money can buy but integrates and interfaces with all the Big Ten and local corporations. They’ve got liaisons and “ambassadors” to ensure the corporate types are protected, albeit with a lot more discretion.
