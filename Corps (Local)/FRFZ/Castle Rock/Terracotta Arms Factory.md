[[../../../AAA Corps/Renraku|Renraku]] subsidiary Terracotta Arms maintains a small facility in Castle Rock. In addition to the factory, Terracotta Armaments maintains a regional office here to provide weapons to the zone’s Sioux and PCC neighbors. Their excess stock tends to find its way onto the streets, especially in Aurora. However, if you want to get your hands on a weapon before it’s been registered and tagged, you’ll need to make a contact at the factory
