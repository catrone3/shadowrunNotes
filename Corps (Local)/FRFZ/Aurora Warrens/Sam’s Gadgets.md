Sam’s Gadgets is an electronics shop specializing in highend custom commlinks and programs. The owner, Samantha ‘Sam’ Hart, was a top-notch programmer for [[../../../AAA Corps/Renraku|Renraku]] in Seattle. She got trapped in the arcology for four days before a rescue op happened upon her. She slipped into the shadows, too shattered to go back behind a desk. During the ’64 Crash, she was decking an S-K system in Europe when the systems went offline and she was dumped. She was KO’d by the dumpshock and woke up post crash not sure what had happened to her. She emerged as a techno shortly after but has never really trusted those skills. She likes to compile sprites and uses them to help her around the shop, but she trusts real code for her hacking.
