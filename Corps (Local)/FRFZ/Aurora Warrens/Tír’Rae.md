#Denver 
A small neighborhood of elves in the eastern part of the [[../../../Locations/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens|Aurora Warrens]]. The residents of Tír’Rae live primarily underground, taking refuge in a series of old mining tunnels. They are fiercely protective of their holdings, and protection is provided by the Silver Thorns, an all-elf gang.
