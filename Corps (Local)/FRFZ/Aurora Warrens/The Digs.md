They ought to call this one "The Dogs." 'cause that's where it's going. This archetypal watering hole stands right on the edge of the slum known as the Warrens. According to the relocation committee's geodetic survey map, the land up for "harmonization" starts at about the 510 block of Chambers Rd, two blocks south of The Digs. On any given day or night, Warrens dwellers pack this place trying to drown their sorrows or scam some way of getting out.
