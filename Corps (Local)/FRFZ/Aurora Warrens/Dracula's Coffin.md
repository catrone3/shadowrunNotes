#Denver 
Dracula’s Coffins is an odd mix of shops. The side that faces the street has two doors, a front walk-in door and a garage door. The two doors don’t lead to the same place. The walk-in door goes into the lobby for Dracula’s Coffin motel. Guests electronically register and pay for time and then receive either an AR map to follow or a small printed map leading them to their coffin section. Once they climb into their tiny quarters, the little box moves. The boxes are constantly changing places for security purposes, and every guest is required to wear a biomonitor. In extreme emergencies, all the boxes open at once and release ladders for guests to climb down either into the center area of the building or outside to the street.
