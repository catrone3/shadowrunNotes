Thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of some retired runners, Paradise Lane provides just about everything anyone would need in the [[../../../Locations/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens|Aurora Warrens]]. The team of runners moved to Denver, and opened up the following shops:  
  
[[Allie Cats XXX]]  
[[Dartguns 2 Smartguns]]
[[Dracula's Coffin]]  
[[Grunt’s Orkish Delights]]  
[[Hole in the Wall]] 
[[Sam’s Gadgets]]
[[Trinket's]]
  
What they lacked was a reliable street doc, and so they recruited one and invited him to open his shop, [[Hippocrates]].
