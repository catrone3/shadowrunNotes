#Denver 
If the Aurora Warrens had a “nice” neighborhood, Southside would be it. It’s relatively calm, and the ZDF even occasionally makes an appearance. The local gangs tend to chase them out just as soon as they appear, but it happens. One can find an assortment of shops and there’s even a semblance of commerce happening in the area. Consequently, this is a highly sought-after neighborhood for controlling said commerce.
