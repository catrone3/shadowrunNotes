#Denver 
The trio of arcotowers that sprouted up during the 2070s are colloquially known as “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.” The arcotower built in Aurora is known as “The Good” – this name is unequivocally ironic.  
  
The Aurora Arcotower was the first arcotower built in Denver. At the time of its construction, The Good was seen as being the next big thing for residential development. just after construction was finished, the situation in Aurora got really tenuous. When the residents began to flee the district and leave it to the gangs to control, the Aurora Arcotower was left abandoned. Squatters moved in, and have kept it (mostly) operational ever since.  
  
The building was originally designed to house 6,000 families of 4, along with several hundred businesses and support personnel. The whole tower was intended to operate much like an arcology, with self-sustainment at the center of its design. Now, population estimates put the building at somewhere around 50,000 squatters. Power and water are just as rare as one would expect in the [[../../../Locations/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens|Aurora Warrens]], but with more difficulty given that the infrastructure of the building is not being maintained.  
  
There are gangs within the building that control whole floors, and kids sometimes grow up without ever leaving the arcotower. These arco-rats are desperate, nearly feral, and completely without education or morality. There have been occasional initiatives pushed forward to demolish the building, but the fact is, it keeps most of the arco-rats inside and off the streets. Demolishing the building would simply cause the residents to spill out into the rest of Aurora, which is already heavily overcrowded.
