Hippocrates’ street clinic is a small operation and not related to the rest of the Paradise Lost crew. Hippocrates appreciates the business increase they have brought to him but often has trouble dealing with the volume. His clinic only has ten beds plus the three operating tables that can double as short-term beds and he only has one assistant (well, had one assistant). He does good patch-up work and can do implant surgeries for a price and up to a certain level. He has the skill for more complex wares but doesn’t have the facilities to install anything too intensive.
