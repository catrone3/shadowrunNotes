#Denver 
Hole in the Wall is a bar with a twist. The owner is Frantic, a free fire spirit. Frantic loves serving drinks on fire and offers a secondary service in the back rooms of her bar. Frantic opens metaplanar gateways for individuals with the right intentions and donation, and “right” is a loosely defined concept that changes with the whims of a spirit of fire. Frantic also offers storage services for objects, and people, that need to be well hidden. She actually takes them to a metaplane and hides them. Best thing about the process is that most objects don’t have the same metaplanar translation, so even if someone were to find where she hides things, the things she hides don’t usually look the same.
