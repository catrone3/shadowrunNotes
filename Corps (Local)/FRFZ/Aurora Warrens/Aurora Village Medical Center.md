(Why is it in the warrens? it was built after the warrens were formed, so unless this was part of a reclamation project it makes little sense)

Built for the 2072 Olympics, the Aurora Village Sports Medical Center represented a unique collaboration between six of the largest biotech companies in the region. Originally the facility was restricted to only being used for athletes in the Olympics, and the expectation was that the facility would be shut down. However there was enough demand that the biotech companies have continued to fund the Medical Center.  
  
Following a rebranding, the Aurora Village Medical Center now caters to more than just athletes. However, only corporate citizens are allowed to get care at the facility.  
  
The irony of having a top-tier medical facility built right on the edge of one of the poorest districts in North America is not lost on the folks who work at the facility. The ZDF have increased patrols in and around the facility, ensuring that transit through the Warrens to the medical center remains safe.
