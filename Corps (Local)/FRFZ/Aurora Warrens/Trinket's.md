#Denver 
Trinketâ€™s is a talismonger shop owned by Trinket, a raccoon shaman who loves all things shiny. Her shop sells everything from formulae to foci and offers enchanting services for custom jobs. She has a deal, and a relationship, with Rattler to enchant the custom weapons he makes under his Enchanted Arms label. Along with all things arcane, she also has decent contacts in the BAD markets and sells Awakened drugs to draw in customers from outside the Awakened community. Many of the foci Trinket makes are easily identifiable as her work because she makes them look like shiny trinkets and baubles.
