#Denver 
Run by Ella Ortiz, a human with a paramilitary background, the Iron Horse Shooting Range is one of the few places in the [[../../../Locations/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens|Aurora Warrens]] that the gangs and syndicates have not tried to take over.  
  
Mostly this is because Ella has a reputation for providing for her neighbors, and the gangs and syndicates recognize that taking a bunch of paramilitary-trained shooters on isn’t what they want. Ella does most of her training with simulators, utilizing simsense technology to get students to train their muscle memory. Advanced students are given training in the range’s shoothouse out back.
