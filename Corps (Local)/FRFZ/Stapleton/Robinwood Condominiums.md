Mostly providing off-base housing for Buckley Air Force Base, the Robinwood Condominiums also sees more civilian traffic than expected. Itâ€™s ideally situated for people who work in the nearby businesses, also for military housing. As a result, it sees a lot of resident turnover and standards for entry are low.
