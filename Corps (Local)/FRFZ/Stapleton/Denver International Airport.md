Denver International Airport (DIA) was once one of the busiest airports in the world. Leading up to the 2072 Olympics, it was renovated very hastily. In the years since, the renovations have diminished and now give the place a shabby appearance. Due to some fiscal malfeasance by the former management, DIA has lost a tremendous amount of business. Following the Reclamation, Ghostwalker replaced all the management and started to pour money into the airport to get it back to the top.  

> Rumors of all kinds of crazy things have followed DIA for decades. One such rumor is that they have tunnels and bunkers below the airport that are used by a global cabal of rich people to escape nuclear apocalypse. Another is that the tunnels are holding everything from the Ark of the Covenant to the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. All these crazy conspiracy theories have led some to believe that there may be a free spirit using Influence and Illusion magic to play a long prank. Personally, I think thatâ€™s yet another crazy theory.
