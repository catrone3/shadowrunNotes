This was once home to a proud squadron of UCAS fighter pilots who loved to show off their aerial prowess, but since Ghostwalker took over the area, the Buckley Air Force Base has been led by the ZDF. Now the ZDF uses it for training their forces in air and ground insertions, as well as for surveillance operations. 

> There’s also a contingent of [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] Global Commsat officers at Buckley. From what I’ve heard, they’ve helped Ghostwalker enhance his network of control over the city. Supposedly, he can directly hijack and control any drone he wants, but that may just be the jazz talking.
