Rocky Mountain Arsenal was a chemical weapons facility in the 1940s. It was finally shut down in the 1990s and rededicated as a national park just in time for the United States to go belly-up a couple decades later. Under Ghostwalker’s direction, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Park flourished. Wildlife made a comeback in the area—including some of the rarer animals.  

> Rare indeed. One such animal is a white buffalo the local Amerinds revere. They believe it is a symbol of abundance and good times to come, and the Sioux are especially protective of it. Ghostwalker’s PR team made quick work of emphasizing that the white buffalo is only safe under Ghostwalker’s protection, of course. This led to an influx of converts to the Church of the Dragon Reborn.
