Like its namesake district, the Broomfield division of the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] tends to be more relaxed than most police forces. Because of Broomfield's primarily white-collar population and reputation as a commuter district, the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] here focus more on smaller offenses, such as ordinance violations and petty crimes.
