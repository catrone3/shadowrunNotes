#Denver 
A top-notch medical facility in Denver, Newlife Medical has contracts with the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] to provide them with upgrades, implants, and medical services at a discounted rate. Thus, the security at Newlife is always better than one would expect, since there are so many officers that literally owe their lives to the doctors there. If you can get in, expect to be treated well and to have excellent service. But know this: they have been known to send off-duty [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] officers to collect on those that fall behind in their payments.
