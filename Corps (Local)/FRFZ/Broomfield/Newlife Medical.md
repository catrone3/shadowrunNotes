#Denver 
A top-notch medical facility in Denver, Newlife Medical has contracts with the ZDF to provide them with upgrades, implants, and medical services at a discounted rate. Thus, the security at Newlife is always better than one would expect, since there are so many officers that literally owe their lives to the doctors there. If you can get in, expect to be treated well and to have excellent service. But know this: they have been known to send off-duty ZDF officers to collect on those that fall behind in their payments.
