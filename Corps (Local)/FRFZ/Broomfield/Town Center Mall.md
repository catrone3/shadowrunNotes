Despite the fact that malls lost their mainstream popularity over a century ago, the Towne Center Mall remains open and busy at most times of the day. Perhaps there’s something that rich people like about being able to touch the goods before they buy them? Rumor has it that the mall’s owners are deeply in debt and are on the verge of closing their doors for good. But for now, busy parents can find respite by spending their nuyen on vapid shopping experiences.
