#Denver 
This neighborhood of mobile homes serves as a bedroom community for neighboring Englewood. Prior to the destruction of Englewood, the area provided cheap labor for the region. Now, most of the folks living here are unemployed. There are many complaints of headaches among residents ever since the Zone Defense Force obliterated Englewood.
