The illustrious Compri Hotel has a well-earned reputation for privacy. This makes it a hotspot for all kinds of people who might benefit from that discretion. Government employees, megacorporate managers, Mr. Johnsons, fixers, runners, spies—they all come to the Compri when in town. However, due to Ghostwalker’s strict rules forbidding espionage, all detected instances of espionage are reported to the ZDF.

( From the outside, this place looks like just another luxury hotel. and the guest rooms force you to agree with that assessment. What makes the Compri Interesting is the so-called Compri Rom, a large, open area on the main ﬂoor full of comfy furniture--<couches and chairs with massage/heat systems. coffee tables, and that drek-arranged in groupings of various size. indirect lighting of varying intensity put some groupings in the spotlight and leaves others in romantic (or comforting) shadow. White-noise generators provide each conversation pit with a surprising degree of privacy, and most of the end tables offer built-in data connections or terminals. There's always coffee (real coffee. not soy-kaf) and tea on the brew. and your guest-room key card operates an auto-bartender In one corer. Ifs a nice. comfortable place to do biz or to hang )
