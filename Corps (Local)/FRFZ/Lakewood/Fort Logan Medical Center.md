#Denver 
Once the Army post for the southwest of Denver, Fort Logan still grooms the large military cemetery planted there. Things change, of course. Denver expanded and surrounded the fort, and the Army moved on. Logan became a mental hospital In the 20th century and. despite Its generic-sounding official name, still serve that function.  
Known a "The Asylum" to locals, Fort Logan Is a pleasant looking place with attractive buildings and well-landscaped grounds. Security works as much to keep people out (and protect the content of the large pharmacy) as to keep people in, but It's unobtrusive.
