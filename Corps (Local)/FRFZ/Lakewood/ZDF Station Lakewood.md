#Denver 
The local headquarters for ZDF operations in the Lakewood district, this region is well known for having criminals who "disappear" while under custody. Rumor has it that any criminal who doesn't get a lawyer quickly may find themselves over at Lakewood Correctional Institute.  
  
The Lakewood division also sends occasional patrols into Englewood, looking for looters, violent criminals seeking refuge, and performing rescue operations for people stupid enough to travel through.
