Part prison, part psych ward, all creepy. Experiments are done on their criminal wards, and they really push the ethical boundaries of what is considered “science” and what is considered “torture.” Their latest round of experiments focuses on BTL addiction. The lead researcher there, Dr. Richard Hutton, has a theory that if BTL was addictive enough, the addict would never need to seek out more. His theory is that this would cripple criminal enterprise, as the addicts would never need to commit crime to fuel the habit.  

> Yeah, there’s a book about an entertainment so addictive people don’t seek out anything else. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t work out well for anyone.

> My belief is that [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] owns the Lakewood Correctional Institute and supplies subjects from their other facilities around the world. There are a lot of similarities between this facility and the one in Las Vegas, but this one is proving a challenge to reveal. Hutton is aware that the technomancer community in the Zone would like nothing more than to expose his atrocities to the world, and as a result he’s beefed up his security like you wouldn’t believe.
