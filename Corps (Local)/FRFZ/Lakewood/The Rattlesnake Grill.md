If you like no-frills Southwester decor, friendly service, good food, and classic R&B, this is the place to hang. The tile ï¬‚oors and mock adobe walls make the place acoustically "live" and pretty fragging loud when the band's playing, but It's more popular as a place to eat, drink, and dance than talk. No dress code and everyone's welcome--corp suits, ganger-wannabes, middle-class wage-slaves. everyone. The cuisine Is Southwester. and the centerpiece of the menu is (surprise!) rattlesnake
