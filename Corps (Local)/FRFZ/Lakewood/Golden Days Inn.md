This place belongs to the same organization that owns the Days Inn capitol Hill In the Aztlan Sector. and thus is officially part of the same chain. A Santa Fe-based management company runs the Golden Days, however, and the difference shows. The Azzie capitol Hill establishment ls a good, solid, moderately priced hostelry; PuebSec's hotel oﬀers services you'd normally expect from a five-star outfit, but at three-star prices.
