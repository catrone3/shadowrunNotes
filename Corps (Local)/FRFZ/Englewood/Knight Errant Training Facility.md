Ever the opportunists, Knight Errant has set up a training facility in the ruins of Englewood. They do live fire training and set up a shoot house to plan for urban assaults. I’ve heard what I hope are just urban legends about Knight Errant forces going to Ketring and getting a bunch of refugees to serve as “OPFOR,” or “opposing forces.
