One of the only places in Englewood to mostly survive the assault, Ketring Park became a refugee town almost overnight. The shacks of the shanty town only barely provide any kind of shelter, and every winter the people camping here suffer more and more. For more than three years, the refugees here have been waiting for relocation. With Ghostwalker opening up citizenship, it’s possible some of them might get out, but it’s more likely that someone will forcibly relocate people to Aurora. 

> This is the place where the shades of Englewood do most of their feeding. All supplies are scarce, and people are willing to do some horrible things to ensure their survival for the next day. Places like this are breeding grounds for spirits of Rage, Envy, Lust, Greed, and of course Despair.

> There’s work to be found relocating people out of the Park. Some of these folks used to be well-connected, and despite the fact that they’re now no better than any other poor slob, with perseverance they can pull the right string to get an escort out. Just be prepared to have to fight off the people who aren’t getting pulled out.
