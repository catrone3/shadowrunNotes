Depending on how you approach this building, you might see the plains to the east or the mountains out west. Thatâ€™s because [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] built this facility with unique exterior panels that mimic the surrounding environment. Designed to curve and move with the landscape, this office is truly an architectural marvel. Rumor has it that this office houses a branch of [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] Internal Intelligence, their own gestapo that monitors internal employees for the Consensus. If true, this might be a gold mine for an intrepid interloper who wanted to get their hands on data about [[../../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] assets.
