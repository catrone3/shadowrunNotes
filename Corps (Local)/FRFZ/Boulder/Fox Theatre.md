A favorite nightclub for students at the University of Colorado for generations, the Fox Theatre is a hint of retro cool in the midst of an ever-changing landscape. It specializes in jazz, indie rock, and even hosts a few poetry slams. An unspecified alum purchased the theatre back in 2068 and began retrofitting it to keep the aesthetic while modernizing the facilities. Youâ€™ll find AR-enabled elements throughout, carefully woven into the art deco styling of the building.
