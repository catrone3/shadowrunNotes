#Denver 
Nederland is a rural community on the outer edges of the Golden district. When the region was run by the Ute Nation the community was a group of outsiders. They were more utilitarian than the rest of the Ute culture, partly due to the harshness of being so far from urban niceties. The tribal dictatorship of the Ute culture also bred a degree of resentment among the Nederland community, who just wanted to be left to their own devices.  
  
When the PCC took over the district, Nederland was largely unaffected. The citizens simply bought up their land shares and continued to operate as normal. The dividends that are paid out by the PCC help to fund improvement projects in the community.
