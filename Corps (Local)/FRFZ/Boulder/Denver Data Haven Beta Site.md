#Denver 
Rumor has it that the Denver Data Haven had a contingency plan in case their old site on the Air Force Academy was compromised. That same rumor indicates that they maintained a “beta site” near the old National Center for Atmospheric Research. If there are survivors, and if the rumors are true, this is where the survivors would muster.
