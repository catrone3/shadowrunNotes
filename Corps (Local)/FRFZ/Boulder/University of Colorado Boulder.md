#Denver 
The University of Colorado recently underwent massive reforms and rebuilding efforts, thanks in large part to the University of Denver. While some might view this as aiding a rival, the universities both saw that there was greater potential in preserving that rivalry than in stifling the competition. The University of Colorado draws substantial numbers of magically active students and has a burgeoning technomancy department that studies the effects of Resonance.
