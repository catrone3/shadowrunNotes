Brighton used to be in the militant Sioux Nation, so it’s hardly a surprise to find that there’s still a strong philosophy of self-defense. The Sitting Bull Shooting Range allows people to come and practice their gun skills with almost any weapon imaginable. They even rent their guns to people for practice time. They can’t sell anything that’s illegal to possess, but they can rent it out. If you want to practice your skill with a Panther Assault Cannon, go for it. Also, they will sell ammo in huge bulk quantities in any caliber you could ever want.
