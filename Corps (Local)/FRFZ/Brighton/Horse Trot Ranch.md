#Denver 
A very large corporate retreat owned by Jarone “HammerJack” Falcone. Falcone purposefully built the whole facility to support secret and clandestine meetings. The ranch is used by corporate types now. No idea how he’s doing under Ghostwalker’s rule, but back in my day he ran a hell of an operation. Soundproofing and counter-surveillance were just the beginning. He also put memory locks on all the guards, so they have no idea who the guests were once their visit is over. He’s still got some sympathy for fellow runners, but don’t abuse his trust.
