Most people don’t realize that [[../../../AAA Corps/MCT|MCT]] does some of its sketchiest research under the names of its subsidiaries. CodeBlue is one of them. They operate a research facility on the farthest outskirts of the Zone, and they’ve even set it up as a Zero Zone. It must be some sort of self-contained facility too, because the only things coming or going are drones carrying supplies. Though supply drones don’t usually get an accompanying combat drone escort.
