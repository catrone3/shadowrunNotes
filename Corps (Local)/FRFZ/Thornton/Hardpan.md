The only business willing to put itself close to the Apex Plasmids algae tanks, Hardpan has a long tradition of catering to the blue-collar workers in the area. The owner, a Sioux human named Susan “Banshee” Johnson, keeps a running list of those who get thrown out with pictures of their beaten faces hanging from the back of the bar like trophies.  

> You’re still welcome in Hardpan if you’re Anglo. Just be cognizant of Sioux traditions like making challenges and contests of strength, will, and intelligence. And don’t get baited into throwing the first punch, because you will get tossed and banned for life.
