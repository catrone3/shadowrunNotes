#Denver 
Fairview Heights is a gated community that ostensibly only allows former PCC residents to live there. Since Ghostwalkerâ€™s ouster of the PCC from Arvada, there are a number of homes in the community that are still owned by the PCC citizens, but stand unused. The PCC landlords are eager to rent these homes to people, in order to turn a profit off these properties.
