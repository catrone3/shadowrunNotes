Apex Plasmids is the largest food producer in the FREZ. They produce almost all the soy, mycoprotein, and algae used by the sprawl. As a result, they own huge swaths of land where they have hydroponic facilities. However, the side effect of all this production is the area around the Complex is just disgusting to smell. Thus, there are not many businesses in the area, other than Hardpan, the rough-and-tumble bar that serves many of the employees.
