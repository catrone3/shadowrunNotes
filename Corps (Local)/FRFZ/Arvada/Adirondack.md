This Is another place that dates back a long way, right back to the first half of the 20th century--or so the management would have you think. The Adirondack hosts its guest In a striking, open-plan brick building that purportedly housed a historic brewery. The centerpiece of the place is the two-and-a-half story-tall copper brewing vat.  
Sorry. chummers. but not all Is as it appears. This neck of the woods did boast a brewery once, but on the other side of the river. That brewery came down 25 years back. Adirondack's owner, one Eric Still Creek. saw pictures of the place and decided the historical connection would b a wizzer marketing coup. He basically replicated the brewery from scratch a couple of klicks away from its original site. The "copper" vat is actually metallicized plastic, and the only beer it's seen comes from sloppy patrons on the outside.  
Still, the food is good. a kind of native Amerind/French cross. It sounds weird. but It works.
