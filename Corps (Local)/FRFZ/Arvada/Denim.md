#Denver 
This is a Hopi-themed nightclub run by the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Koshari|Koshari]] crime syndicate. There is usually business to be done here, assuming it is done with discretion. The [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] knows that this is a [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Koshari|Koshari]] nightclub—they just can’t prove that anything illegal is going on here. The fact that most of the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] in the area are former PuebSec officers probably helps ensure that evidence remains unnoticed. 

> They have a free spirit who acts as a bouncer on the weekends. His name is Tawa, and he often manifests as a large Hopi man with a long black ponytail and thick arms. You don’t want to get on his bad side.
