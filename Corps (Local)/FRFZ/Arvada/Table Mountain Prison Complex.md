#Denver 
Located within hollowed-out areas of Table Mountain, this super-max prison is said to be nearly impossible to escape. A lucky few have managed to escape through the top, but the cold air, harsh winds, and steep descent create a small pile of bodies near the streets below that is regularly cleaned up by the ZDF.
