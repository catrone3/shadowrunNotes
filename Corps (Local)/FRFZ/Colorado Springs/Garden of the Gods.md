A massive 1,300-acre park made of natural sandstone formations, this park was a private park until the owner’s death. Upon his death, the park returned to the property of the nearby community. The park now serves as a communal area for hiking, camping, and ritual magic. 

> During the brief period when the Azzies took over this region, they attempted to use the Garden’s energy to fuel some pretty heinous rituals. Ghostwalker’s been spending a lot of time and money since trying to restore the Garden to its original glory.
