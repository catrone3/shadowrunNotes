I didn’t get close to this place. As soon as I was near, it seemed that the wind started gusting and pushing me off the mountain.

The Shrine looks like a stack of stones atop Cheyenne Mountain(you mean in the zoo?), but it’s actually a really tall tower and a small church. The Shrine of the Sun was built to commemorate the memory of humorist Will Rogers. Briefly taken over by Aztlan during the 2050s, the shrine was rededicated to Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of the sun. Since then, the tower has been inhospitable to anyone not of the Aztec faith, with spirits actively opposing anyone who attempts to approach it
