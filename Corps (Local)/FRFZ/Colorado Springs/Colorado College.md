A small college that formerly focused on arts and other soft skills. Since the Awakening, Colorado College has added a rigorous magical curriculum. Their magical studies focus on all the major traditions, but hermetics and shamans are by far the most popular. The region is heavily patrolled by Lone Star in an effort to protect the valuable “resources” (students, faculty, materials, etc.).  

> The students are more than happy to help with research initiatives to earn a little spending money on the side.
