Formerly a US Army base, Fort Carson now belongs to Ghostwalker and is used primarily to train his elite mercenary group, the Black Talons. They have a range for small arms training, a simulated urban environment, and they perform aerial maneuver training for insertions and extractions. Fort Carson also boasts a top-notch medical facility, but itâ€™s only available to the Black Talons.
