#Denver 
Estancia is the name of one of the busiest neighborhoods in Arvada. Originally a “master-planned” community for the sleepy bedroom district, its proximity to The Hub and Lakewood have made the area more densely populated than anyone planned. The neighborhood boasts a few restaurants and bars and a police station that is manned by ZDF forces.
