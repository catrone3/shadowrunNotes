#Denver 
The primary station for all maglev and subway traffic throughout the Zone. There’s a maglev route that connects Boulder, Denver, and Colorado Springs, and subways that connect all the districts of the Denver metropolitan area. Just be aware that if you’re boarding a train bound for the PCC or Sioux nations, you’ll have to go through customs just like if you were crossing the DMZ.
