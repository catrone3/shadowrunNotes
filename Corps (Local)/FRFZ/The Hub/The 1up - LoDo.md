#Denver 
Owned by an old runner, This bar became very popular for runners to go to and find work. the High security in the area meant that very few people carried any kind of weapons that was bigger than a pistol. This also meant that the bar was very secure. Which is nice since it is also an arcade bar, featuring old arcade machines from as far back as 1980.
