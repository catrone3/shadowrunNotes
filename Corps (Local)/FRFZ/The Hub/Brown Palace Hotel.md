#Denver 
The original Brown Palace hotel was built in Denver in 1892. This hotel has remained open ever since, but it has undergone significant renovations over the nearly 200 years of its history.  <br>  <br>The Brown Palace Club, a triangular-shaped bar, was made into a speakeasy during Prohibition and became a popular watering hole in the decades afterward.  <br>  <br>The Club has become famous for being haunted as well. Guests have reported that they feel the carpet moving under their feet, crawling along like something alive. There are also reports of a man in a uniform, who looks like a train conductor, standing in the doorway, staring at guests before walking through a wall into nothing.  <br>  <br>Because of the magical significance of the hotel, along with its carefully-curated collection of original artwork, the hotel has fantastic magical and physical security on-premises. Guests are expected to treat any spirits or entities as they would another guest.

> Both the club and hotel are said to be haunted, with guests reporting things like feeling the carpet moving or seeing even a train conductor standing in the doorway. Because of its magical significance, the hotel is popular with spirits, and guests are expected to treat every spirit as if they were another guest.
