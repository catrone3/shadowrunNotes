#Denver 
On the corner of 20th street and Arapahoe, across from the greyhound terminal, the Splatter Bar is part of a small chain of bars throughout CAS and UCAS. The bar is 3 stories of grey concrete with tall narrow windows on the outside. Inside are multiple levels of balconies and catwalks with colored lights and steaming pipes for that faux urban jungle feel.  
The original Splatter Bar offered paint ball rounds with games of “Shoot the DJ” and had sprinklers to hose down the patrons. Times change. The new Splatter Bar hosts a node with a full spectrum augmented environment and offers AR firearms with the cover charge. The dance floor is more of a gauntlet as “ARmed” guests and virtual beasties roam the joint
