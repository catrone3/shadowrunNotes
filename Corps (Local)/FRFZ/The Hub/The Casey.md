#Denver 
Year after year, the Casey is voted as one of the best places to live in the Hub. The Casey represents Ghostwalkerâ€™s vision for how Denver should look. A tall skyscraper built of sustainable materials, maintained by a swarm of drones and spirits at all times, built in harmony with the surrounding nature rather than in opposition to it. Additionally, almost any metatype can be housed here and the dragon is exalted at every turn.
