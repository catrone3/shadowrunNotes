#Denver 
Five by Five is a favorite haunt for smugglers and coyotes. Located in an unused cistern beneath the Hub, the bar has a reputation for being discreet and relaxing despite its dank surroundings. The bar has a tradition that helps reinforce this reputation: if you discuss business openly, you must buy everyone a round. The owner of Five by Five is a hobgoblin rigger named Squid, who knows just about every smuggler and coyote in the FRFZ personally.  

> Squid set up a series of repeaters to ensure a strong signal, even underground in a cistern. Sometimes, those repeaters need work. If you’re willing to go digging around in the sewers of Denver, Squid pays pretty well considering, and it’s a great way to ingratiate yourself to the rigger community.
