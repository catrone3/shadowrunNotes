#Denver 
It's a Conner-Westin. What more can we say? Once In the lobby. you might as well be in Danzig or Durban or Detroit. Only the occasional, half-hooped hint of what some no-brained corporate decorator defined as Southwestern decor lets you know you're In Denver. About the only thing that sets it apart is the half-Indoor, half-outdoor swimming pol, which extends out onto a patio exactly one mile (1,609 meters) above sea level.
