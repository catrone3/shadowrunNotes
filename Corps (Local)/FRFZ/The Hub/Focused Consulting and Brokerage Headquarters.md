The worldwide headquarters for Focused Consulting and Brokerage (FCB), a consulting firm that manages “problems” for elite clientele, is a prominent Hub building. The story goes that FCB is a corporate fixer of sorts, arranging jobs for high-end runners to be paired up with clients at a decent rate.  

> If you’re approached for a job with FCB, it means you’ve reached the top of the game. No one knows who owns FCB, but the rumor mill is churning with suggestions that everyone from Ghostwalker to Daniel Howling Coyote own the company. Of course, no one within FCB is going to reveal the truth.
