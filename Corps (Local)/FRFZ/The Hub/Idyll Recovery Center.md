The Idyll Recovery Center is one of the region’s most effective recovery facilities. They treat addiction, mental illnesses, and brain trauma. The president is a young doctor, Dr. Paul McKnight, who proved himself to be a prodigy when dealing with mental ailments. His techniques are somewhat controversial, but extremely effective.  

> Okay so this is a bit of a conspiracy theory, but hear me out. I’ve heard rumors that people who go into Idyll sometimes come out as technomancers. And that they go on to be employed by Ghostwalker. I have no idea if this is true, and it sounds completely insane, but if it is true, then that means someone may have found a way to force Emergence. And it would explain where Ghostwalker is getting his little army of technomancers.
