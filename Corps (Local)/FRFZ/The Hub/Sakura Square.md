#Denver 
Since 1973, Sakura Square has been the heart of the Japanese experience in Denver. At its heart is the Tri-State Denver Buddhist Temple, which has stood on this site since 1947. Since then, the Square has expanded slightly to include a small shopping mall, and it can be rented out for events. Due to the square having both commercial and religious aspects, there have been extensive legal battles over the privacy of the events that take place. Without a direct order from Ghostwalker, the ZDF policy is to leave the events alone without an abundance of legal cause. As a result, Sakura Square has seen extensive use by the Karemasu Clan.
