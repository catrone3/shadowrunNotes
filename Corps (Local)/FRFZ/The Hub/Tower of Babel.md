#Denver 
This bar/nightclub on the UCAS side of the Hub is a popular gathering place for all sorts of Denverites, including Dean Costello of the Casquilho family and other underworld types. Noted for its tall, etched-glass windows and the dynamic, colorful AR displays on its interior walls, the club recently underwent significant renovations after the dramatic appearance of a large alchera in the Hub. True to its spirit, it turned the rebuilding into an excuse for an inventive series of parties that incorporated the sounds of construction into the pounding rhythms of the club’s music. As a result, the club didn’t drop a bit in popularity while it rebuilt
