#Denver 
The Church is one of the oldest nightclubs in Denver. The building is much older than the nightclubâ€”originally a cathedral built in 1865. The Church features nightly live performances ranging from classic EDM to modern trog rock. When Weekday Eclipse was torched, the Church held a massive candlelight vigil for the victims. Rumors are that the Church is also owned by Perianwyr, but they were discounted as fiction created to drive away business.
