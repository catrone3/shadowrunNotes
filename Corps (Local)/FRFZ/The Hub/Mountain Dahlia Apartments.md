#Denver 
A no-frills apartment building that caters to the burgeoning metahuman population in the area. When the area was owned by the CAS, metahumans were required to enter through the back door even if they were legally allowed to rent. Now, everyone is free to come and go as they please. For many, this is an improvement.
