#Denver 
Under the careful, watchful eye of Ghostwalker, the Denver Zoo takes great care of its animal residents. The zoo is permitted to contain any non-sapient critter or paracritter, so long as the environment is kept as authentic as possible. The zoo has a display of mated greater phoenixes on loan from the PCC, which serve as a huge draw for the crowd when the phoenixes begin their mating dance only to incinerate each other and then be reborn in front of everyoneâ€™s eyes.
