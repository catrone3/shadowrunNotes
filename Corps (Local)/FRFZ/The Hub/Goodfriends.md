Goodfriends has undergone substantial changes over the years. It started as a family-friendly pizza parlor, but its current incarnation is as a club known for quiet and discreet hooking up. In the early 2070s, the owners thought they would start to gather blackmail material on the people using their many private rooms, but the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] cracked down hard on that activity. Now, the only threat is from other patrons, and business has thrived as a result. 

> I can tell you that theyâ€™re still spying on the customers and using that information. The owners have just become much better at hiding it and distributing the information through third parties, to distance themselves as the source. I may have helped them out with this on occasion.
