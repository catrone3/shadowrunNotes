#Denver 
The Luxe apartments are a high-rise luxury apartment building that is generally reserved for Ghostwalkerâ€™s guests and those that can afford to live like a dragon. The security here is managed by former [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] chief Charles Jack, who hires mostly former [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] staff. Sometimes the staff is augmented by [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] active officers who are moonlighting for additional hours, experience, and nuyen.
