#Denver 
The Luxe apartments are a high-rise luxury apartment building that is generally reserved for Ghostwalkerâ€™s guests and those that can afford to live like a dragon. The security here is managed by former ZDF chief Charles Jack, who hires mostly former ZDF staff. Sometimes the staff is augmented by ZDF active officers who are moonlighting for additional hours, experience, and nuyen.
