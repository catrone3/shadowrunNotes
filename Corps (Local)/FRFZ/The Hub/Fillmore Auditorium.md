#Denver 
One of the older nightclubs in Denver, the Fillmore Auditorium hosted bands for almost a century and retains its venerable and illustrious status. Since the destruction of Weekday Eclipse, the Fillmore Auditorium has seen a lot more bands perform. Acts here run the gamut from modern rock to classical. The Fillmore hosts weekly shows that raise money to help artists who were displaced by the arrest of Perianwyr.
