#Denver 
A very unpleasant coffin-style hotel, but close enough to downtown that visitors to the sector will put up with the grunge for the convenience. Gordon Letson owns and runs the place. and he seems to spend most of his life wandering around the building. He has some major ax to grind against Amerind shamans and doesn't care who knows It
