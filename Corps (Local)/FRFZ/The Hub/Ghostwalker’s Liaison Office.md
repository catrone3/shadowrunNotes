#Denver 
If you must go to this building, you better have a great reason. Ghostwalker’s liaison, Nicholas Whitebird, lives and works in this building. As the living embodiment of the great dragon, all his edicts are broadcast from these offices. The [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] maintains a constant vigil alongside Ghostwalker’s contingent of spirit allies. This building starts with two stories of regular floors before it forks out into four narrow, fifty-five-story spires that appear to be covered in dragon scales, with habitable floors only on the upper and lower floors. It stands as a testament to Ghostwalker’s dominance.
