#Denver 
Among the many government buildings full of paydata in the Hub is the ZDF Headquarters. Among its other duties, the ZDF is working to enforce Ghostwalker’s prohibition on espionage—which, in a rather ironic twist, means they have to engage in some espionage themselves, as the best way to catch a spy is to spy on them. The headquarters, then, have a large amount of information about ongoing investigations and techniques employed by the ZDF.
