Among the many government buildings full of paydata in the Hub is the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] Headquarters. Among its other duties, the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]] is working to enforce Ghostwalker’s prohibition on espionage—which, in a rather ironic twist, means they have to engage in some espionage themselves, as the best way to catch a spy is to spy on them. The headquarters, then, have a large amount of information about ongoing investigations and techniques employed by the [[../../../Factions/FRFZ/Zone Defense Force|ZDF]].
