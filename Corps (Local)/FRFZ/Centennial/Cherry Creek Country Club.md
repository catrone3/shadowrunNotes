#Denver 
Back in the day, Centennial was run by the CAS, and their … old-fashioned attitudes are still somewhat prevalent in the area. The Country Club is a bastion of racism and misogyny. For more than a century, it’s only allowed human men to play, and uses human women as trophies and waitstaff, exclusively. Not surprisingly, the nearby University of Denver won’t tolerate that kind of thing, and so protests are an increasingly common sight.
