The second airport for the Centennial District, Chamberlain Airport is substantially smaller than Centennial Airport. Itâ€™s primarily a commuter hub for sky taxis, helicopters, and similar vehicles. Given its proximity to the university, it also sees some use from the richest corp kids going to school there. The airport cannot handle any kind of non-vertical takeoff or landing craft, but if you want to get a helicopter and need it quickly, this is the place to go
