One of the larger airports in the Zone, the Centennial Airport caters to corporate types. It’s not used for leisure travel, in part because it’s so far from touristy attractions. It’s located close to Castle Rock on the south end of Centennial and can support all kinds of aircraft. Some of the maintenance staff have a side gig where they’ll do work on your t-bird or whatever, putting it into an underused hangar. Just make sure that the corporate owner of that hangar doesn’t come back while the work is being done on it.
