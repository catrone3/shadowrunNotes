For those of you who might be a century old, I’ve heard of a thing called “public broadcast services” that used to be available to anyone and anywhere. The Free Zone Voice is modeled on that concept. They’re based out of the University of Denver, and they get by without a lot of ads or corporate sponsorships. As a result, they’re about the closest thing to a free and independent journalistic source in the Zone. Instead of focusing on investigative journalism, they prefer to work on what they call micro-news, deep dives on narrow topics, and frequently getting the voice of the common person on the street
