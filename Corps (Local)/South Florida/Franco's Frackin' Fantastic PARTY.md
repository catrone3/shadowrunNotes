Good ol' Franco (high-ranking Lieutenant of Cienfuego) sure knows how to throw a fantastic party! This 24-hour-a-day party never stops. Drugs, guns, wo/men, and fun!Â   
  
When Franco's party is inevitably shut down by the authorities he simply moves it somewhere else in the area. Keep in the know and you too can be at the hottest underground party in town.
