[[../../Players/Berlin Team|Berlin Crew]]

[[../../NPCs/Friendly/Germany/Evangelia Kaufmann|Evangelia Kaufmann]] calls the team and lets them know that there is a Johnson who wants to hire them. The client wants to meet at Caf√© Mameluk. Hired by an SK johnson to grab a new magic gun. The security is surprisingly hight

Angel gets molested, and they try to rape her as they force her on her knees.
Max gets handed a fake commcode from a Renraku research club.
They capture a professor who created the original rounds, these rounds are fragile to the point that if someone's aura touches it. the rounds trigger. For this reason, the gun has a secondary signature on it that keeps it from interacting with the users. It uses the signature of a ritual that is triggered by the guns trigger mechanism. 

The professor has hooked up with several students, These students all hit on him via some slight of hand on his part. But with the students believing it was their doing he believes he is in the clear on this side. Especially with one of his buddies being the principal of the school and him being on top secret projects from the company.
