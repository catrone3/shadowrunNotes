# Diederich's secret
[[../Players/Berlin Game|Berlin Crew]]
[[../NPCs/Friendly/Germany/Immo Mauer|Immo Mauer]] will contact the team to do some real world research for them. They are looking to find the source of these odd shipments that are going through the docks controlled by Serpil Diederich. The team is offered 45,000 nuyen to find out both what these shipments are and where they are coming from. When looking at the shipment logs, they are listed under things like 10 hammers with a value of 500,000 nuyen. or 3 nails guns with a value of 700,000 nuyen. Immo thinks these look odd,  and would like you to track these down and follow it back as there is nothing on the matrix side.
