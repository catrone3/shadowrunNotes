Evangelia has a Johnson(Hanno FÃ¤rber) that wants to have the team remove a building and the records of it existing in the targets databases.  (20,000 nuyen) 10 karma

The building is a storage house. Inside there are 4 metal containers. The building is built over the river, so it can be dropped into the river and forgotten. (if they check the containers there are people in them. If they don't these people are located in next job). Records are on the host and a paper copy in a safe. 

people in containers 
- Polychronia Maathias - Oni (Pandora) and Yan Wolsky Karp - Elf (Leviathan). Name the Dwarf thinks it is - Yoshimitsu Miya.


Evangelia will then call them for a job from a different Johnson (a matrix search of the face will show it is the owner of the location they just hit (Serpil Diederich)). They need you to steal some items from a target (previous Mr Johnson if they asked for a picture). The items include two cars as well as several metal containers that are powered by mini fusion reactors. These have people in them that were kidnapped in some way. (30,000+10,000)
