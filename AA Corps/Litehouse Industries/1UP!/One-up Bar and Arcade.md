#Denver 
Divided into three sections, the main room of this entertainment venue is the One-Up Bar and Grill, a typical bar with a contemporary style, serving drinks and food along with occasional live music. The OneUp Arcade is a game room featuring reproductions of video game machines from a century ago as well as an assortment of modern AR game areas. The OneUp Back Room is a dark and smoky members-only private club that is actually a hangout for runners—the only real membership requirement being good street rep. The owner of the bar, Carol “Cat” McTavish, is a retired runner and well-known fixer, and occasional Mr. Johnson, in the Denver shadow scene.
