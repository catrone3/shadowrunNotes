The [[../Atlantean Foundation|Atlantean Foundation]] runs its affairs out of this tall building. Visitors are permitted on the first two floors, which are dedicated to their collection of relics, promotional materials for their organization, and public relations. The remaining five floors are off-limits to the public and presumably are reserved for the [[../Atlantean Foundation|Atlantean Foundation]]â€™s meetings, support staff, and perhaps even more secure storage. The presence of a basement vault has been hinted at but not confirmed.
