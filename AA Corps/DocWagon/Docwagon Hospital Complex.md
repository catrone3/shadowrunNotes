#Denver   
The largest [[../../../AA Corps/DocWagon|DocWagon]] facility in the FRFZ boasts some of the top docs in the sprawl, as well as the best trauma center Denver has to offer. If you’ve got an emergency, go to the trauma center. For other services, get a visitor’s pass (forged or real, whichever) and make your way to room 4-203. A few docs in the complex run an under-the-table street clinic there. They won’t do anything excessively complicated, like full limb replacement, but they’ll do some quick and dirty jobs for you. It’s more expensive than most street clinics, but the care is way more competent
