Established by [[../../../AAA Corps/Shiawase|Shiawase]] to help spread the influence of Shinto the region, the priests who work in this small temple are high-level Shinto priests. These priests serve as eyes and ears for [[../../../AAA Corps/Shiawase|Shiawase]], in addition to holding the religious services they are called to perform. The shrine is dedicated to Inari, the foxlike messenger kami. It boasts a small walking trail covered with torii in a fashion similar to the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Japan.  

> Do not mess with the priests. They are all highly initiated magicians with a lot more magical mojo than you. Plus, since the area is deeply aspected toward Shinto, they will have every advantage in a fight. Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to not fight them, but I did see them take out a shedim once, and it was a very enlightening experience.
