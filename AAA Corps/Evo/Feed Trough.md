Feed Trough was built by [[../../../AAA Corps/Evo|Evo]] with the expectation that centaurs were an underserved market. Turns out, it’s also popular with non-centaurs due to the work of their excellent chef, Monique Labonté. The Feed Trough is one-hundred-percent vegan and organic, and it gets most of its produce from local farms in the Elbert and Stapleton districts.
