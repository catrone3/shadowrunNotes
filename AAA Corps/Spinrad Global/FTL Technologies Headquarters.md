FTL is kind of a hot mess. I talk a lot more about the FTL/Warpdrive fiasco in my section about Matrix Hotspots. If you want deeper details, that’s where you should look. For now, just know that FTL is owned by a guy named Charles Lightfoot, and he wants to take his company private. It’s currently owned by [[../../../AAA Corps/Spinrad Global|Spinrad Global]], so that’s a huge problem for him. His past is also coming back to haunt him as well since the ownership of FTL has changed hands a few times, things are a little convoluted when it comes to tracking down who owns what within FTL
