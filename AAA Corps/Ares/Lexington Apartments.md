The “Lex” as the locals call it, is an imposing and grand apartment building standing 25 stories tall. While the primary purpose of the Lex is to provide housing to [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] employees, the building is privately owned, and property can be purchased or rented out. The security here is top-notch, as is to be expected from any place where [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] has a presence.
