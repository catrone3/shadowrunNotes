Once a public school, McAuliffe is now wholly owned by [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] Macrotechnology. [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] brings in faculty from around the world to teach their students the latest in self-defense, military theory, and business strategy. Itâ€™s a combination of military education and business school, which pretty much describes [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] to a T. Graduates here are usually fast-tracked into management positions within [[../../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]].
