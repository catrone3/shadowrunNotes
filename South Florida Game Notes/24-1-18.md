#### Run Report
The team learned where the King's Hand was, and took it to the server room. Once in the server room they put the hand with the servers and destroyed the data Aztechnology had. They grabbed a copy before blowing it up and turned over the data to Lady Nightshade via Nexus, and learned what the King's hand is before destroying their copy.
