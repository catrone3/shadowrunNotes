#### Run Report
After some time looking at the data from the Aztech Black site, Lady Nightshade calls with a new job. She wants the team to kidnap a Mr. Jose Cañas from the Aztechnology building Downtown. She is willing to offer the team 25,000 nuyen each for the job. He has an office on the 73rd floor of the Aztechnology building downtown. She warns that while they will probably get in without setting off an alarm, the way Aztechnology has their systems keeping the alarm from sounding on their way out may be hard. So having backup options is a good idea. 

a self-deploying or “smart” parachute (consider it a Rating 6 skillsoft that will interface with the user’s commlink and provide instructions or automatic deployment if the player is unconscious) $500 nuyen each.
