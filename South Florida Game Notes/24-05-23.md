## Synopsis
**The Last Stand of the Conquistadors:**
   A group of treasure hunters stumbles upon the remains of a Spanish conquistador expedition deep in the Everglades, where they uncover a lost treasure map leading to untold riches. The team is hired by a rival group to intercept the treasure hunters and claim the treasure for themselves. However, they soon discover that the spirits of the conquistadors still linger in the swamps, guarding their treasure with a vengeful fury.

## Mission

Lady Nightshade calls with a new job. She thinks she found the last Artifact. The bad news is there is a rumor that there are treasure hunters trying to find this place as well. One of them had a timed upload of a treasure map that triggered, The best guess is this was done incase they fail to get back for some reason. Either way the treasure map was found in Biscayne Park according to the post. It points to a location out near the old Nike Missile Base, HM69. I had a spirit try to go out and see what was there, but all it found was a large mana barrier. Not wanting to risk alerting it returned with just that. Based on the barrier being force 9.

There is a force 9 lodge with improved invisibility cast on the barrier itself.
