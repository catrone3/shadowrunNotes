#### Run Report
The team is attacked after leaving the Mystique Emporium, They take out the attackers and leave. Once the team returns to Lady Nightshade, she takes the data they recovered and gives them a new task. They are to retrieve Dr Thorne from his home.

The team arrives with no issue. While talking to Dr. Thorne Aztechnology tries to force Dr. Thorne to return with them. The team waits to see what Dr. Thorne does, who after seeing the team do nothing walks out the front door and does a mob mind on the Aztech mercs getting them to leave. This left 1 merc unaffected that the players scared into running with his teammates when his gun jammed.

With Dr. Thorne in the van the team heads to the drop point Lady Nightshade told them. They drive past a group of Veilkeepers who try to go after Encanto's white pickup truck. Encanto leads them off else where while the rest of the team finishes the job.
