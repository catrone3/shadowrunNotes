#### Run Report
The team was called by [[../Players/South Florida/Mako|Mako]] to help her recover some equipment and supplies from a container ship just off the coast. She offered the team 10,000 nuyen each and was talked into 15,000 nuyen each. The team went out like they were going fishing near the container ships before they got as much info as they could and just assaulted it. The team captured one of the juggernauts that were used to defend the ship from pirates. we broke for the night before the team assaulted the tower and bridge.
