#### Run Report
The team use logic on possible exit points for the emergency exits and find one in an old sewer tunnel. They get the door in and Samsara, Encanto, and Blue head in. Samsara triggers a prep trap and takes 11 stun nocking him out. The team use a stim patch and head back up and wait for just over an hour so that samsara is at full health again before trying to see where the traps are. They do not see any more traps and are fairly certain that there are more. So the they grab the spare tire and roll it in front of them to set off any of the traps as they walk forward.

The three of them get to the facility and find that the door enters into a warehouse area. They search and find three security uniforms to take and use as a disguise. They do not have any badges for it at this time, but talk through how to get through it
