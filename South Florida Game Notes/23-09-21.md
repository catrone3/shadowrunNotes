#### Run Report

The game started with the players knowing where the target team were hiding out. The players got close to the building then snuck their way into the building. They found the runner team on the third floor and had decided to negotiate with them first as they just needed a copy of the papers.

After successfully talking the runners into letting them copy the papers, the team went back to Lady Nightshade and turned the papers over to her. After about 30 minutes looking over the papers she returned to them with a new shadowrun, retrieve the vail.
