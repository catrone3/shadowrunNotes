#### Run Idea
The team gets a call from fixer by the name of Lucky. He lets them know that a Johnson wants to meet the team at a sleazy slightly flooded restaurant. The Johnson wants the team to take out a rival of theirs. The run goes without too much of an issue. The target is located in Normandy Shores, attempting to play golf at an old golf course that is no very dangerous. 

The team will run into a few ghouls when they get on the course, they can sneak by or just kill them as they are feral. The target has a team of 4 body guards to deal with any ghouls that get too close. A good portion of the course has standing water from the flood damage that no one wanted to try and fix. Area has a background count of 4
