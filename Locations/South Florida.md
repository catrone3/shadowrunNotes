## Geographic Notes

#### Broad Causeway

It's "Broad" because it's named for the investor who built it and is surprisingly narrow. The section that runs through Belle Meade is walled off and well monitored to keep out the slum trash.

#### Bimini

These island are part of the Bahamas which remain part of British Commonwealth, not the Caribbean League. In practice, these two tiny islands are collectively one of the greatest pirate havens in the Atlantic. The rest of the Bamahas are generally more lawful and carefully ignore this western hive of scum and villainy.
#### Ft. Lauderdale International Airport

A tribal owned airport, this facility does nearly as much business as the Miami International Airport to the south. Traffic here is exclusively civilian and unarmed, though the tribes have no shortage of militarized airbases in the region, keeping this airport demilitarized eases border tensions.

#### Lion Country Safari

A drive-though safari experience with mundane and magical animals from all over the world.

#### Port of Miami

One of the major remaining money maker for the Gunderson corporation, which used to own nearly all of Miami. The port does astounding business in cruises, passengers, and cargo.




#### Stiltsville

A sprawling island of squatter homes built from driftwood and scavenged homes (not all abandoned) that supports a local "fishing" operation, mostly held above the sea on stilts.Â  Lots of smuggling, piracy, drug manufacturing, bespoke cyberware chop shops and other low quality illicit activities.  
  
Somehow nothing illicit is ever found on raids, as though the locals get advanced notice.
### History

#### The Fall of Gunderson
In 2061 Art Dankwalther, a former employee of Fuchi seeking revenge, orchestrated the downfall of Gunderson Corporation. He strategically bought out the majority of the companies that supply Gunderson, causing them to lose clients and suffer financial difficulties. Other corporations take advantage of Gunderson's vulnerability, further weakening the company.

As a result, Gunderson's stock plummets, losses increase, and the corporation is forced to divest itself of unprofitable subsidiaries. Global Oil acquires Montclair Industries, and Wuxing absorbs TransSea, Gunderson's shipping division. However, despite these measures, Gunderson continues to decline, losing assets and experiencing a mass exodus of investors, clients, and employees.

The city of Miami, where Gunderson is headquartered, faces a surge in crime and increased corporate competition due to Gunderson's weakened state.

#### The Meistersinger Massacre
After the fall of Gunderson, Miami became a warzone. This only lasted for a few years before order was returned but during that time the pirate Crimson Wave got into a huge fight with local gang the BioHawks. The battle should have been quick, but the BioHawks put up a good fight that ended up taking place mostly in the bay. This fighting got the attention of someone or something that got a pack of Meistersingers to come into the bay. This in of itself is something that never happens as it is just not deep enough for them to spend time there. When the Meistersingers showed up, the fighting angered them to where they then caused a tsunami to hit the fighters and as a byproduct most of Miami. The tsunami was upwards of 25 meters in height, destroyed much of the cities buildings as anything under 3 stories near the coast was washed away.  There were more than 10,000 people killed. This devastation led to the formation of a new South Florida government to take control of the situation and start to bring order back to the area.

#### The A-Corp Wars
After the formation of the new South Florida Government, thousands of A level corps flood to the area. This was in part a way to help rebuild the region without the government spending money and also to help stabilize the regions crime and piracy. As it turns out, this did little for the second. If anything it made it worse, The crime just became much less public and handled by more and more runners. Piracy and smuggling also rose during this time. 


#### Modern Miami
Miami as a whole is ridden with crime, although you wouldn't know this as a tourist. Lone star does a
