## Geographic Notes

#### Broad Causeway

It's "Broad" because it's named for the investor who built it and is surprisingly narrow. The section that runs through Belle Meade is walled off and well monitored to keep out the slum trash.

#### Bimini

These island are part of the Bahamas which remain part of British Commonwealth, not the Caribbean League. In practice, these two tiny islands are collectively one of the greatest pirate havens in the Atlantic. The rest of the Bamahas are generally more lawful and carefully ignore this western hive of scum and villainy.
#### Ft. Lauderdale International Airport

A tribal owned airport, this facility does nearly as much business as the Miami International Airport to the south. Traffic here is exclusively civilian and unarmed, though the tribes have no shortage of militarized airbases in the region, keeping this airport demilitarized eases border tensions.

#### Lion Country Safari

A drive-though safari experience with mundane and magical animals from all over the world.

#### Port of Miami

One of the major remaining money maker for the Gunderson corporation, which used to own nearly all of Miami. The port does astounding business in cruises, passengers, and cargo.

#### The Wrecks

The Seven Storms season was a great catastrophe for the city. Three large ships came loose and plowed through these bridges and islands, two cruise ships and one container ship, along with numerous smaller vessels. These islands are abandoned and a chaotic mass of broken buildings and torn up boats.
