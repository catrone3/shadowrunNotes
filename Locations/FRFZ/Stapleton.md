The easternmost district of Denver, Stapleton takes up a large amount of land but is not densely populated. Most of that land is used for large corporate facilities and is mostly off-limits. There is a small area of Stapleton, close to the city, where you’ll find a more typically Denver experience.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Ares Global Commsat Office|Ares Global Commsat Office]]
Located on Buckley Air Force Base, the local branch of Ares Global Commsat assists the ZDF with monitoring and surveillance activities. Home to one of the largest antennas in the region, the command and control center here can assert control over any of the ZDF drones in the sprawl.

#### [[../../AAA Corps/MCT/Brainwave, Inc. Office|Brainwave, Inc. Office]]
The local office for Brainwave, Inc., a Mitsuhama Computer Technologies subsidiary. This is a research facility that keeps a low profile out on the far edges of the Stapleton district. I’ve never met anyone who has gone in there, but Voxel has.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Buckley Air Force Base|Buckley Air Force Base]]
This was once home to a proud squadron of UCAS fighter pilots who loved to show off their aerial prowess, but since Ghostwalker took over the area, the Buckley Air Force Base has been led by the ZDF. Now the ZDF uses it for training their forces in air and ground insertions, as well as for surveillance operations. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Casquilho Imports|Casquilho Imports]]
The Casquilho Family runs their mafia operations out of this storefront. Of course, the ZDF can’t prove it, but it’s an open secret. It has a large warehouse in the back that stores nick-nacks from California, and the Casquilho Family runs their smuggling operations from that warehouse, disguising the illegal goods among the legitimate ones.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Children of the Dragon Headquarters|Children of the Dragon Headquarters]]
The Children of the Dragon believe that Dunkelzahn was their messiah. Following the appearance of Ghostwalker, a splinter sect broke off and called itself the Church of the Dragon Reborn. The two churches have been at odds ever since. Given their proximity to each other, it’s not uncommon to see members of each church trying to poach each other’s members. It’s a very petty fight in the end, since we all know that Jibbers is our true lord and savior

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Denver International Airport|Denver International Airport]]
Denver International Airport (DIA) was once one of the busiest airports in the world. Leading up to the 2072 Olympics, it was renovated very hastily. In the years since, the renovations have diminished and now give the place a shabby appearance. Due to some fiscal malfeasance by the former management, DIA has lost a tremendous amount of business. Following the Reclamation, Ghostwalker replaced all the management and started to pour money into the airport to get it back to the top.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Front Range Space Port|Front Range Space Port]]
Ghostwalker poured some money into building a space port out in the far reaches of Stapleton, east of Denver International Airport. The idea is not a new one, but it’s impressive to see a dragon who cares about space flight. He’s trying to compete with places like the mass driver in Kenya. If successful, it could mean a new age of tech and business innovation for the FRFZ.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Marcel’s|Marcel’s]]
While this may appear to be a mainstream Italian restaurant on the surface, it is owned and heavily visited by the Casquilho Family. Additionally, the waitstaff is odd, employing changelings and people with radical body modifications. There’s a bunch of one-way mirrors from which the Casquilho family monitors visitors.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Northwind Farmstead|Northwind Farmstead]]
The Northwind Farmstead is the largest, oldest farm in the entire area. Run by the same family since the late 1800s, Northwind provides almost all the fresh produce in the sprawl.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Old Mammoth Stadium|Old Mammoth Stadium]]
This is an old Lacrosse stadium that is used when the broncos stadium is in use. Because of this it is not as well maintained and has squatters in the down time

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Robinwood Condominiums|Robinwood Condominiums]]
Mostly providing off-base housing for Buckley Air Force Base, the Robinwood Condominiums also sees more civilian traffic than expected. It’s ideally situated for people who work in the nearby businesses, also for military housing. As a result, it sees a lot of resident turnover and standards for entry are low.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Rocky Mountain Arsenal Park|Rocky Mountain Arsenal Park]]
Rocky Mountain Arsenal was a chemical weapons facility in the 1940s. It was finally shut down in the 1990s and rededicated as a national park just in time for the United States to go belly-up a couple decades later. Under Ghostwalker’s direction, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Park flourished. Wildlife made a comeback in the area—including some of the rarer animals.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/Stapleton Airport|Stapleton Airport]]
This is the oldest civilian airport in the sector. However, it was decommissioned in the 1990s when Denver International Airport was built. Stapleton was rebuilt when the sectors were divided, so the buildings relatively unused and in good shape despite being so old. With the increased funding going toward the Denver International Airport again, Stapleton is back on the bubble for closing. The only traffic they see is municipal short-range flights from commuters, skycabs, and helicopters.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Stapleton/ZDF Station Stapleton|ZDF Station Stapleton]]
The local ZDF station to manage affairs in the Stapleton district. The ZDF forces here also provide security to the Denver Airport. They also have a specialized all-Awakened division of Arsenal Rangers who provide security for the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Park.
