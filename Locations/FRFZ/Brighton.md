Brighton is located on the far northeastern edge of the Zone, bordering the Sioux Nation. It’s incredibly rural, especially when compared to the rest of the Zone. It is named for the largest town in the area, but with a population in the low thousands, it’s hard to say there’s a lot of reasons to visit. That being said, there are some very interesting locations within the Brighton district that take advantage of the ruralness to provide an extra layer of privacy and security.

## Geographic Notes

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Brighton/Boot Lake Community|Boot Lake Community]]
One of the new developments in the Front Range district, the Boot Lake Community is currently only open to UCAS residents. The community prides itself on its strict standards, but those standards are prone to slippage considering that the UCAS administration is trying hard to revitalize their dwindling population in the area.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Brighton/Change the Range Solar Farm|Change the Range Solar Farm]]
One of the advantages to being in a massive, flat, rural plain is that you can open a solar farm. The Change the Range solar farm actually provides almost all the electricity requirements of both the Brighton and Stapleton districts. If something were to happen to the Castle Rock Fusion Plant, this solar farm is slated to provide power to the Hub at the expense of all other districts

#### [[../../AAA Corps/MCT/CodeBlue Biotech Office|CodeBlue Biotech Office]]
Most people don’t realize that MCT does some of its sketchiest research under the names of its subsidiaries. CodeBlue is one of them. They operate a research facility on the farthest outskirts of the Zone, and they’ve even set it up as a Zero Zone. It must be some sort of self-contained facility too, because the only things coming or going are drones carrying supplies. Though supply drones don’t usually get an accompanying combat drone escort.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Brighton/Horse Trot Ranch|Horse Trot Ranch]]
A very large corporate retreat owned by Jarone “HammerJack” Falcone. Falcone purposefully built the whole facility to support secret and clandestine meetings. The ranch is used by corporate types now. No idea how he’s doing under Ghostwalker’s rule, but back in my day he ran a hell of an operation. Soundproofing and counter-surveillance were just the beginning. He also put memory locks on all the guards, so they have no idea who the guests were once their visit is over. He’s still got some sympathy for fellow runners, but don’t abuse his trust.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Brighton/Pearson Park|Pearson Park]]
Hoo-boy is this a crazy place. Only ever went there once, and I’m lucky I made it out alive. Story goes that the town of Fort Lupton used to be a suburb of Denver that did pretty well for itself. Following the Awakening, though, the town started to experience a bunch of weird phenomena. There was an unspecified “natural disaster” in the town that forced everyone to evacuate—this was around the time of the First Treaty of Denver, so it was sort of lumped in with the Anglos leaving the newly created Sioux Nation territory. Fast forward to today, and the place is overrun with flora of all kinds. It’s like nature did more than just reclaim the town, it devoured it whole. No one has been able to figure out what happened here exactly, but it’s extremely dangerous.

#### [[../../AA Corps/Litehouse Industries/Genesis Medical/Platte River Medical Clinic|Platte River Medical Clinic]]


#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Brighton/Safiya’s Critter Care|Safiya’s Critter Care]]
Just your average, run-of-the-mill pet clinic catering to a rural community. Or it would be, if not for the fact that Safiya’s a gifted geneticist. She can actually whip up some chimeric animals in this clinic, which makes her a tidy sum on the black market. If you need some patching up while you’re in Brighton, Safiya’s a good person to know. In addition to her pet clinic, she operates as a rural version of a street doc.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Brighton/Sitting Bull Shooting Range|Sitting Bull Shooting Range]]
Brighton used to be in the militant Sioux Nation, so it’s hardly a surprise to find that there’s still a strong philosophy of self-defense. The Sitting Bull Shooting Range allows people to come and practice their gun skills with almost any weapon imaginable. They even rent their guns to people for practice time. They can’t sell anything that’s illegal to possess, but they can rent it out. If you want to practice your skill with a Panther Assault Cannon, go for it. Also, they will sell ammo in huge bulk quantities in any caliber you could ever want.

#### [[../../AAA Corps/MCT/VOR Robotics Office|VOR Robotics Office]]
Another MCT subsidiary, hidden away out in rural Brighton. Unlike CodeBlue Biotech, VOR Robotics isn’t very secretive. It’s also not a Zero Zone. VOR Robotics is a drone manufacturer, specializing in drones that look like animals.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Brighton/ZDF Station Brighton|ZDF Station Brighton]]
A sprawling complex that used to be run by the Sioux, the Brighton ZDF station maintains an on-premises jail annex that can house up to 1000 offenders. It also features a courthouse and the main operations center for the ZDF in the region.
