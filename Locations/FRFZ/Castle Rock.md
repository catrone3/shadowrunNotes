Named for the large rock formation to be found just east of I-25, Castle Rock is sparsely populated but maintains some of the most critical infrastructure for the entire FRFZ. The district is focused heavily on the I-25 corridor, which splits the district in half going northsouth. Most of the important areas are within a few kilometers of I-25, which means the rural areas to the extreme east and west are virtually unused.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Castle Rock/Castle Rock Fusion Plant|Castle Rock Fusion Plant]]
Built inside the Castle Rock (in game author may have exagurated this a bit), the fusion plant is run by Shiawase’s Fuzion subsidiary. It serves as the primary source of electricity to the entire FRFZ. It provides clean, nuclear power for millions of homes and businesses, and the whole operation is primarily subsidized by Ghostwalker. Shiawase maintains a strong military presence here, given that the whole thing is a giant fusion bomb just waiting to go off (not how fusion power works).

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Castle Rock/Meridian Townhomes|Meridian Townhomes]]
Located near the CAS DMZ, the Meridian Townhomes have gotten an ill reputation for being a home to smugglers and ne’er-do-wells. The place is in constant flux, and people are lucky to have steady utilities.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Castle Rock/Pradera Resort|Pradera Resort]]
Craving a western-themed break from the hustle and bustle of the city? Come to Pradera. The massive 250-acre resort includes three golf courses, two horse tracks, secluded wooded areas, and rentals for log cabins. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Castle Rock/Sedalia Airport|Sedalia Airport]]
Sedalia is a relatively small international airport, built by the PCC after the Denver Treaty to serve as the sector airport. It is a modern facility that was updated just before the Olympics with the latest security. But despite its modernity, it is relatively under-used, even during the Olympics. It often serves as the secondary airport for most flights, because it almost always has at least one runway free and has the most modern emergency response and repair teams of any airport in the sprawl. It is the other major airport that has semi-regular boost suborbital flights, though most of these are PCC-sponsored flights to their own microgravity production facilities.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Castle Rock/Stonegate Judicial Complex|Stonegate Judicial Complex]]
The Stonegate Judicial Complex is a large prison that also houses a small judicial wing for trials. The homeless from Englewood and Castle Rock sometimes will try to get arrested during the winter for vagrancy. It’s better to be in a ZDF prison than on the streets during the harsh winters.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Castle Rock/Terracotta Arms Factory|Terracotta Arms Factory]]
Renraku subsidiary Terracotta Arms maintains a small facility in Castle Rock. In addition to the factory, Terracotta Armaments maintains a regional office here to provide weapons to the zone’s Sioux and PCC neighbors. Their excess stock tends to find its way onto the streets, especially in Aurora. However, if you want to get your hands on a weapon before it’s been registered and tagged, you’ll need to make a contact at the factory

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Castle Rock/ZDF Station Castle Rock|ZDF Station Castle Rock]]
The ZDF runs operations for the Castle Rock district from this facility. Prisoners are kept here no more than two days before being shipped off to Stonegate.
