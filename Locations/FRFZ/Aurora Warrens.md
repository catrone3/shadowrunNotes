The Aurora Warrens is a land of urban blight and decay. The other Denverites thought that the residents of Aurora bred like rabbits, which is where the name “Warrens” originated. Many, many years later, some residents prefer to live underground, away from Ghostwalker’s prying eyes. This has only reinvigorated the use of “rabbit” as a slur against the residents. Things went downhill for Aurora back when the area was targeted as a source of wealth that needed seizing following the First Treaty of Denver. Wealthy people moved out, often going to nearby Englewood, and they were replaced by high-density, low-income housing. Land values plummeted, which some hoped would lead to a surge of development in the area, but that never transpired. Public utilities are a joke in the Warrens. Most residents have to buy their water from the local gangs, who get it from the Quincy Reservoir. For electricity, most residents have to scrape together their own generators and power them via refurbished solar panels, old-fashioned fuels, or even hand cranks. All this is to say essentially: avoid the Aurora Warrens if possible

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Aurora Village Medical Center|Aurora Village Medical Center]]
Built for the 2072 Olympics, the Aurora Village Sports Medical Center represented a unique collaboration between six of the largest biotech companies in the region. Originally the facility was restricted to only being used for athletes in the Olympics, and the expectation was that the facility would be shut down. However there was enough demand that the biotech companies have continued to fund the Medical Center.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/The Digs|The Digs]]
They ought to call this one "The Dogs." 'cause that's where it's going. This archetypal watering hole stands right on the edge of the slum known as the Warrens. According to the relocation committee's geodetic survey map, the land up for "harmonization" starts at about the 510 block of Chambers Rd, two blocks south of The Digs. On any given day or night, Warrens dwellers pack this place trying to drown their sorrows or scam some way of getting out.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/The Good|The Good]]
The trio of arcotowers that sprouted up during the 2070s are colloquially known as “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.” The arcotower built in Aurora is known as “The Good” – this name is unequivocally ironic.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Iron Horse Shooting Range|Iron Horse Shooting Range]]
Run by Ella Ortiz, a human with a paramilitary background, the Iron Horse Shooting Range is one of the few places in the Aurora Warrens that the gangs and syndicates have not tried to take over.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Meat Market|Meat Market]]
If you’re Infected in Denver, you better know about the Meat Market in Aurora. Built into an old mall on the north end, it’s an open secret that the place is run by Tamanous. They cater, literally, to the special dietary needs of the Infected. It’s a great place to find buyers for any fresh “product” you might have available.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Ok Food and Stuff|Ok Food and Stuff]]
Local bodega selling whatever alcohol they can get their hands on

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Paradise Lane|Paradise Lane]]
Thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of some retired runners, Paradise Lane provides just about everything anyone would need in the Aurora Warrens. The team of runners moved to Denver, and opened up the following shops:

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Quincy Reservoir|Quincy Reservoir]]
Known to locals as “the Rez”, the Quincy Reservoir is the only place where locals can find reliably clean water. Compared to the rest of the FRFZ, the water is toxic beyond compare—but for the rabbits of the Warrens, this is their best option. Distribution and collection are controlled exclusively by the Fronts, a gang that I’ll be covering in more detail later. Needless to say, there are constant fights as residents squabble over their share of the water.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Smoky Hill Marketplace|Smoky Hill Marketplace]]
The 'Aurora Warrens’ very own open-air souk! One can find almost anything here, provided that you’re okay with things that are previously used. And by “previously used,” I mean “still covered in the blood of the previous poor sap who bought the thing."

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Southside|Southside]]
If the Aurora Warrens had a “nice” neighborhood, Southside would be it. It’s relatively calm, and the ZDF even occasionally makes an appearance. The local gangs tend to chase them out just as soon as they appear, but it happens. One can find an assortment of shops and there’s even a semblance of commerce happening in the area. Consequently, this is a highly sought-after neighborhood for controlling said commerce.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Tír’Rae|Tír’Rae]]
A small neighborhood of elves in the eastern part of the Aurora Warrens. The residents of Tír’Rae live primarily underground, taking refuge in a series of old mining tunnels. They are fiercely protective of their holdings, and protection is provided by the Silver Thorns, an all-elf gang.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Trinket's|Trinket's]]
Trinket’s is a talismonger shop owned by Trinket, a raccoon shaman who loves all things shiny. Her shop sells everything from formulae to foci and offers enchanting services for custom jobs. She has a deal, and a relationship, with Rattler to enchant the custom weapons he makes under his Enchanted Arms label. Along with all things arcane, she also has decent contacts in the BAD markets and sells Awakened drugs to draw in customers from outside the Awakened community. Many of the foci Trinket makes are easily identifiable as her work because she makes them look like shiny trinkets and baubles.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Aurora Warrens/Warzone|Warzone]]
The Warzone was the epicenter of the Aurora Warrens. It’s where the whole blight began to spread, and because of that “cultural significance” the gangs fight over this area constantly. The winner is generally short-lived, holding the neighborhood for hours or maybe days before losing it to someone else. The few residents here are the truly desperate, even by Warrens standards.
