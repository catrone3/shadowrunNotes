Commerce City is a densely populated blue-collar district just north of the Denver city center. The region has always been sort of second-best behind other districts, which has left many of the residents with something of a chip on their collar, especially toward the well-to-do districts

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Commerce City/Apex Plasmids|Apex Plasmids]]
Formerly known as Denver Foodstuff's, Inc., Apex Plasmids was once the primary producer of dietary algae for Denver and surrounding areas. The facility was heavily damaged in the year of the comet and never fully rebuilt. This site is now a shell of its former self and all of the growth has moved up north. Processing of the algae still takes place on this 1/2 square mile facility

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Spinrad Global/FTL Technologies Headquarters|FTL Technologies Headquarters]]
FTL is kind of a hot mess. I talk a lot more about the FTL/Warpdrive fiasco in my section about Matrix Hotspots. If you want deeper details, that’s where you should look. For now, just know that FTL is owned by a guy named Charles Lightfoot, and he wants to take his company private. It’s currently owned by Spinrad Global, so that’s a huge problem for him. His past is also coming back to haunt him as well since the ownership of FTL has changed hands a few times, things are a little convoluted when it comes to tracking down who owns what within FTL

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Commerce City/Hardpan|Hardpan]]
Located between the algae tanks, the sewage treatment plant. and Riverside Cemetery. the watering hole named the Hardpan Isn't In one of the better neighborhoods of Denver. It does a solid, regular trade, though, and the owner-Raquel Sands, "Sandy" to her fiends and colleagues-is doing well for herself. The Hardpan is the preferred meeting place for many of the Sioux Sector's runners-the Amerindian ones. at least--and serves a something of a hiring hall.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Commerce City/Krupp Chemicals Refinery|Krupp Chemicals Refinery]]
One of the largest employers in the district, Krupp Chemicals maintains a large refinery that straddles both sides of Brighton Road. Here, they manufacture and refine industrial chemicals. Most of the Commerce City population is employed by Krupp Chemicals, so there’s no chance they’re going anywhere soon, but environmental activists have long expressed concern about the plant’s safety and security.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Commerce City/The Solution|The Solution]]
A bar that sits near the Krupp Chemicals Refinery. The story goes that it was built by a chemist who used to work for Krupp Chemicals who had the idea that it’d be a fancy bar with lots of chemistry puns. Unfortunately, no one wanted a bar like that, and he went deep into debt before killing himself. The current owners joke that he found his solution in the end. Now it’s your basic blue-collar bar where you can find locals drowning their sorrows. It’s a great place to get info if you can ingratiate yourself. Don’t go flaunting money or influence, though—those don’t work on people like this. Make them think you’re a roughneck, and you’re in.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Commerce City/Timber Lodge|Timber Lodge]]
These rustic-looking townhomes are commonly used by employees at Warpdrive Systems. The facility has a lot of turnover, which means that they are often looking to rent rooms with relatively little background check. If one has a Warpdrive employee ID, that’s enough for their purposes

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Horizon/Truman Distribution Networks Office|Truman Distribution Networks Office]]
Truman Distribution Networks (TDN) is the largest media outlet in the region. They got to be big enough to attract the attention of Horizon and Ares. Ares bought them out and traded them to Horizon in exchange for Horizon’s PR work on their Excalibur fiasco. There was some debate about integrating TDN into Horizon’s office in Boulder, but they decided that this facility still had  enough value to keep it active.

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Evo/Tsuruga International Warehouse|Tsuruga International Warehouse]]
You won’t see the name Tsuruga International on many of the packages you get delivered, but most of them pass through this warehouse at some point or another. It’s a customs warehouse for all goods entering or leaving the FRFZ, and Tsuruga International is the company fortunate enough to hold that contract.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Commerce City/Warpdrive Systems Headquarter|Warpdrive Systems Headquarter]]
The other side of the FTL coin. The important thing to know about Warpdrive Systems is that their CEO, Steven Ridgemont, is a very well-connected dwarf. He’s got money coming in from somewhere that I can’t account for, as he’s rolling with deeper pockets than he should have. What’s he doing with all that money? Hiring shadowrunners to tear down his competition.
