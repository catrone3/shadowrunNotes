The third and southernmost city in the FRFZ, Colorado Springs has undergone a sort of exodus in recent years. At various points, the city has been claimed by Aztlan, the CAS, the PCC, and now Ghostwalker. All these shifting powers have led to the city being poorly managed and many residents leaving for greener pastures. Still, there are some diehards who refuse to give in and hope to restore the city to its  
former glory

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Broadmoor|Broadmoor]]
A longtime staple of the district, the Broadmoor is a resort for the ultra-wealthy. The fact that it's now controlled by the PCC has only made the Broadmoor even more exclusive.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Cave of the Winds Mountain Park|Cave of the Winds Mountain Park]]

#### [[Geographic Locations/Cheyenne Mountain|Cheyenne Mountain]]
Formerly the home of the US military’s NORAD division, the Cheyenne Mountain installation is a massive honeycomb of tunnels and elevator shafts. No one knows just how deep into the mountain the complex goes. It has lain abandoned since the First Treaty of Denver, but recently people in the nearby areas have been going missing, and conspiracy theorists think that something in the Cheyenne Mountain is kidnapping people.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Cheyenne Park|Cheyenne Park]]
The center of the working class in the southern part of the district, the Cheyenne Park community has a great number of rental properties. The landlords are usually up in Denver, and rarely come to check in on their tenants, so long as the rent is turned in on time.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Church of the Holy Word|Church of the Holy Word]]
Despite Ghostwalker’s Reclamation, the Church of the Holy Word continues its mission of proselytizing its unique brand of Christianity. The church represents a well-funded and well-organized front, with a militant arm called the Followers of the Holy Sword. Rumor has it that they have connections to the Human Nation. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Colorado College|Colorado College]]
A small college that formerly focused on arts and other soft skills. Since the Awakening, Colorado College has added a rigorous magical curriculum. Their magical studies focus on all the major traditions, but hermetics and shamans are by far the most popular. The region is heavily patrolled by Lone Star in an effort to protect the valuable “resources” (students, faculty, materials, etc.).  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Colorado Springs Maglev Station|Colorado Springs Maglev Station]]
The southern tip of the FREZ Maglev route, this station is located centrally to Colorado Springs. Because of the connecting routes to Denver, anyone entering or leaving the station should assume that their every move is being heavily monitored.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Denver Data Haven Ruins|Denver Data Haven Ruins]]
Housed in the McDermott Library of the former US Air Force Academy, the Denver Data Haven had access to the US Air Force’s cyberwarfare suite, extremely strong data connections to the whole world, and lots of redundant systems to ensure operation even in the event of a cataclysm. Unfortunately, no one could have built a site to withstand the attacks of Ghostwalker. When Ghostwalker razed the Denver Data Haven, all personnel were considered killed in action. (this is counter to what the timeline mentions in False Flag)

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Aztechnology/Energia Viva Solar Farm|Energia Viva Solar Farm]]
When the US Air Force Academy was in use, this solar farm provided power to the entire academy. Aztechnology subsidiary Energia Viva managed to acquire some of the infrastructure and arranged to purchase the land from the PCC prior to the Reclamation. Because of the importance to the infrastructure, they’ve been allowed to continue operations, albeit with a lot of oversight from Ghostwalker’s administration.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Fort Carson|Fort Carson]]
Formerly a US Army base, Fort Carson now belongs to Ghostwalker and is used primarily to train his elite mercenary group, the Black Talons. They have a range for small arms training, a simulated urban environment, and they perform aerial maneuver training for insertions and extractions. Fort Carson also boasts a top-notch medical facility, but it’s only available to the Black Talons.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Foxdale Apartments|Foxdale Apartments]]
These apartments can barely qualify as apartments. They rarely have running water or electricity, and the gangs in the neighborhood are going to be the ones that collect your rent. The Foxdale does have one advantage though: no one really cares who you are.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Garden of the Gods|Garden of the Gods]]
A massive 1,300-acre park made of natural sandstone formations, this park was a private park until the owner’s death. Upon his death, the park returned to the property of the nearby community. The park now serves as a communal area for hiking, camping, and ritual magic. 

#### [[../../AA Corps/Litehouse Industries/Genesis Medical/Genesis Summit Medical Clinic|Genesis Summit Medical Clinic]]

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Hospital General Colorado Springs|Hospital General Colorado Springs]]

#### [[../../AA Corps/DocWagon/Palmer Park Hospital|Palmer Park Hospital]]
The local DocWagon hospital in the region. One of the unique features of Palmer Park Hospital is that it abuts Palmer Park, which offers a plethora of trails and natural resources that support holistic healing. The Palmer Park Hospital is one of the better hospitals in the area for magical healing as well.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Peak View Housing|Peak View Housing]]
This is just-off-the-base housing that commonly gets used by soldiers who have finally gotten a promotion and can move off-base. The conditions are marginally better than the barracks. It is worth mentioning that if one lives here, they can be evicted to make room for soldiers.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Peterson Airport|Peterson Airport]]
Built on the former Peterson US Air Force base, Peterson Airport now caters almost exclusively to commercial travel. It’s one of the best ways to get into Colorado Springs, and even though it’s on the far eastern part of town, it’s well connected to all the major highways and roads.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Quail Hill Lodge|Quail Hill Lodge]]
If you need a place to lay low in Black Forest, this is the place to be. The community of mobile homes sits atop a small hill. At some point, the owners decided to build tunnels into the hill, which provide for quick escape or a place to hide.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Rockrimmon Hills Apartments|Rockrimmon Hills Apartments]]
One of the tallest buildings in the area, this apartment complex stands 10 stories tall and provides living conditions for most of the nearby area’s workers.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Shrine of the Sun|Shrine of the Sun]]
The Shrine looks like a stack of stones atop Cheyenne Mountain(you mean in the zoo?), but it’s actually a really tall tower and a small church. The Shrine of the Sun was built to commemorate the memory of humorist Will Rogers. Briefly taken over by Aztlan during the 2050s, the shrine was rededicated to Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of the sun. Since then, the tower has been inhospitable to anyone not of the Aztec faith, with spirits actively opposing anyone who attempts to approach it

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Tesla Experimental Station|Tesla Experimental Station]]
Legend has it that this is where Nikola Tesla performed some of his most famous electricity experiments. The building itself was demolished long ago, but the residual energies seem to have created an alchera that manifests there monthly. If one is particularly lucky, they may find a powerful spirit of air that manifests as Nikola Tesla and will answer questions about his life. The accuracy of these answers has not been ascertained.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/The Bad|The Bad]]
The trio of arcotowers that sprouted up in the 2070s are colloquially known as “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.” The tower in Black Forest is officially called known as The Briargate Arcotower, but everyone that doesn’t live there calls it “The Bad” because it’s controlled with an iron fist by a group of religious fanatics.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/ZDF Station Colorado Springs|ZDF Station Colorado Springs]]
The ZDF runs operations for the Colorado Springs district from this location. Given that this station is at the far southern end of the Front Range Free Zone, the ZDF have upgraded facilities here to handle long-term incarceration, border disputes, and smuggling operations.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Colorado Springs/Zebulon’s Revenge|Zebulon’s Revenge]]
A local watering hole that has been around for a few years, Zeb’s Revenge is a favorite for the Colorado College students. There are rumors that the spirit of Zebulon Pike (not to be confused with Zebulon, the spirit that Ghostwalker fancied) wandered in one night and bought everyone a round of drinks before disappearing and leaving the bar tab unpaid. The stories grow more fantastic the longer one hangs around and the more drinks one has imbibed.
