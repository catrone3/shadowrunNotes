Easily the largest district in the Zone, the Front Range encompasses a huge 2,500 square kilometers of the most mountainous and rugged terrain in the area. It’s the district furthest west of the Zone and stretches all the way from Boulder to Colorado Springs. This district has a few areas of dense population, centered around resorts and casinos in the mountains

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Front Range/Blackhawk Resort and Casino|Blackhawk Resort and Casino]]
The Blackhawk Resort and Casino siphons money from tourists with an ease and grace that one is hard-pressed to find outside of Las Vegas. But unlike Las Vegas, the Blackhawk can offer views of the Rocky Mountains from their wraparound heated infinity edge pool. The ten-story resort has more than two hundred rooms that vary in accommodation to suit every budget.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Front Range/Echo Mountain|Echo Mountain]]
A man-made mountain that was built in the 1960s, Echo Mountain has changed hands many times. It has the distinction of being the only ski resort in the sprawl that hasn’t been overtaken by nature. The security here is top-notch, with drones flying about to ensure that only authorized skiers are present.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Front Range/Glacier Brewery|Glacier Brewery]]
While most of the FRFZ is known for its breweries, none are as storied as the Glacier Brewery. Once owned by any number of corporations, everyone that ever took possession of the company went bankrupt. Now the company is out of business and the factory appears shut down, yet somehow Glacier products keep getting on shelves.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Front Range/Red Rocks Amphitheater|Red Rocks Amphitheater]]
The Red Rocks Amphitheater is one of the most amazing structures ever built. What started as a naturally occurring amphitheater was built up and perfected by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The amphitheater has hosted every major musical act from the Beatles to Maria Mercurial.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Front Range/ZDF Station Front Range|ZDF Station Front Range]]
Normally I wouldn’t cover a ZDF station in this sort of thing—it’s safe to say that most of them are pretty similar. However, this one is unique and therefore deserving of its own entry. The extremely mountainous terrain of the Front Range district demands that ZDF officers are trained in survival techniques their more urban brethren are not. Additionally, the Front Range district has a larger-than-normal presence of drone patrol forces, and they are trained in border security and counter-smuggling operations.
