The living, breathing, heart of Denver, the Hub serves as Ghostwalker’s personal enclave of perfection. During the First Treaty of Denver, it was neutral ground for all the nations that had sectors. Now, it’s the tower from which Ghostwalker exerts his control over the region. The sky of the Hub is abuzz with sky taxis, drones, and spirits. The ground is flush with pedestrians and cars. It’s dense, crowded, and has an electric feel that is hard to replicate.  
The Hub is home to more corporate facilities than any other district of the Zone. In it, you can find offices dedicated to Architectural Dynamics, Awakened World Research, Spellweaver Consortium, and UnlimiTech. The other corporate facilities are unique enough to deserve their own entries
