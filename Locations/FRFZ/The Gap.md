The Gap is an area between Castle Rock and Colorado Springs districts and has almost no population at all. It’s even more rural than the neighboring Elbert and Front Range districts. The place is mostly highway, with I-25 running north and south through the middle of it, and almost no commercial or residential value.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/The Gap/MCT Zero Zone|MCT Zero Zone]]
Very little is known about this location. The only thing known for sure is that this is one of the infamous MCT Zero Zones. The building itself is described as short, which implies that anything valuable is stored underground. But good luck getting in there to find out what MCT is storing.
