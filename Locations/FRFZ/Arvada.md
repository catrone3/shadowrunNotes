Located just north and west of the city center, the Arvada district is a large area that covers about 230 square kilometers of mostly urban space. On the western edges of the district, things get more rural and spread out. On the eastern edges, things are very dense. Arvada is still very much a bedroom community for the larger Denver region.


## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Arvada/Adirondack|Adirondack]]

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Arvada/Atlantean Foundation Offices|Atlantean Foundation Offices]]
The Atlantean Foundation runs its affairs out of this tall building. Visitors are permitted on the first two floors, which are dedicated to their collection of relics, promotional materials for their organization, and public relations. The remaining five floors are off-limits to the public and presumably are reserved for the Atlantean Foundation’s meetings, support staff, and perhaps even more secure storage. The presence of a basement vault has been hinted at but not confirmed.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Arvada/Casa Bonita|Casa Bonita]]

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Arvada/Denim|Denim]]
This is a Hopi-themed nightclub run by the Koshari crime syndicate. There is usually business to be done here, assuming it is done with discretion. The ZDF knows that this is a Koshari nightclub—they just can’t prove that anything illegal is going on here. The fact that most of the ZDF in the area are former PuebSec officers probably helps ensure that evidence remains unnoticed. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Arvada/Denver West Marriott|Denver West Marriott]]
The Denver Marriott Wet Is owned by Marriott Hotels of Cheyenne, a wholly owned subsidiary of Marriott Hotels international--a not-s-subtle means of circumventing some of Ute's more arcane corporate-ownership laws. No matter whose name's on the data work, however, this is a Marriott. And that means god service, bland decor, and relatively high prices. Note that this place is in the 'burb of Golden.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Arvada/Holiday Inn Denver Sport Center|Holiday Inn Denver Sport Center]]

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Arvada/The Rack|The Rack]]
