At one point, Englewood was one of the richest districts in the Zone. All of that changed over the course of a couple of days at the end of October in 2074. Seizing their opportunity, Aztlan moved troops into Englewood and set up shop. For some unknown reason, Ghostwalker allowed this for four whole years. As the catalyst for the Reclamation, Ghostwalker and the ZDF unleashed holy hell upon the district. Starting from just south of the University of Denver, Zone forces systematically bombed and burned every building and residence until they reached the southern border of Englewood. By then, the Azzies had been annihilated, along with the rest of Englewood. Officially, Englewood doesn’t have a seat on the council. The only reason I mention it here at all is because there are still people and places of interest.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Englewood/Ketring Park|Ketring Park]]
One of the only places in Englewood to mostly survive the assault, Ketring Park became a refugee town almost overnight. The shacks of the shanty town only barely provide any kind of shelter, and every winter the people camping here suffer more and more. For more than three years, the refugees here have been waiting for relocation. With Ghostwalker opening up citizenship, it’s possible some of them might get out, but it’s more likely that someone will forcibly relocate people to Aurora. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Englewood/Knight Errant Training Facility|Knight Errant Training Facility]]
Ever the opportunists, Knight Errant has set up a training facility in the ruins of Englewood. They do live fire training and set up a shoot house to plan for urban assaults. I’ve heard what I hope are just urban legends about Knight Errant forces going to Ketring and getting a bunch of refugees to serve as “OPFOR,” or “opposing forces.
