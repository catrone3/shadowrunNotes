Lakewood is Arvada’s southern neighbor, putting it on the southeastern corner of the Denver metropolitan area, and there’s something of a friendly rivalry between Arvada and Lakewood. The regions share a lot in common, with both being sort of bedroom communities for suburbanites, and both sharing a reputation for mediocrity. However, Lakewood is a bit more blue-collar than Arvada, and they claim to have a greater appreciation for hard work.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/All the World’s a Stage|All the World’s a Stage]]
This place is an absolute drekhole of a bar. The only reason I’m even mentioning it is because it’s affiliated with the Ghost Riders go-gang, and they’re kind of odd. I’ll let Bifrost explain. The Ghost Riders are a go-gang that likes to roam 470 around town. What makes them unique is that they use magical effects to make their motorcycles look like flaming horses, or appear to be chased by thunderclouds that spark lightning, and things like that. If you see anything like that coming your way, get off the road. The Ghost Riders aren’t the most violent go-gang, but they’re definitely the most stylish. I cover them in a bit more detail in the … People to Meet section

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Ares Arms Factory|Ares Arms Factory]]
As the largest single manufacturer of guns and ammunition in the world, Ares Arms has factories all over the place. This is just another one of those factories. While you can get the guns easily enough that you don’t necessarily need to steal them, one of the things that makes this a juicy target is that you can get blueprints for weapons that haven’t yet been released to market.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Columbine Knolls|Columbine Knolls]]
This neighborhood of mobile homes serves as a bedroom community for neighboring Englewood. Prior to the destruction of Englewood, the area provided cheap labor for the region. Now, most of the folks living here are unemployed. There are many complaints of headaches among residents ever since the Zone Defense Force obliterated Englewood.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Compri Hotel|Compri Hotel]]
The illustrious Compri Hotel has a well-earned reputation for privacy. This makes it a hotspot for all kinds of people who might benefit from that discretion. Government employees, megacorporate managers, Mr. Johnsons, fixers, runners, spies—they all come to the Compri when in town. However, due to Ghostwalker’s strict rules forbidding espionage, all detected instances of espionage are reported to the ZDF.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Denver School For Advanced Learning|Denver School For Advanced Learning]]
This is a school setup by Cat and Incubus to house the kids that they save or find on runs. They will be taught by people skilled in their fields to bring them all up to skill. They will also be taught how to survive in the real world. Enough of the school is finished at the start of 2082 to have the kids move in and start learning.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Docwagon Hospital Complex|Docwagon Hospital Complex]]
The largest DocWagon facility in the FRFZ boasts some of the top docs in the sprawl, as well as the best trauma center Denver has to offer. If you’ve got an emergency, go to the trauma center. For other services, get a visitor’s pass (forged or real, whichever) and make your way to room 4-203. A few docs in the complex run an under-the-table street clinic there. They won’t do anything excessively complicated, like full limb replacement, but they’ll do some quick and dirty jobs for you. It’s more expensive than most street clinics, but the care is way more competent

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Fort Logan Medical Center|Fort Logan Medical Center]]
Once the Army post for the southwest of Denver, Fort Logan still grooms the large military cemetery planted there. Things change, of course. Denver expanded and surrounded the fort, and the Army moved on. Logan became a mental hospital In the 20th century and. despite Its generic-sounding official name, still serve that function.  
Known a "The Asylum" to locals, Fort Logan Is a pleasant looking place with attractive buildings and well-landscaped grounds. Security works as much to keep people out (and protect the content of the large pharmacy) as to keep people in, but It's unobtrusive.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Golden Days Inn|Golden Days Inn]]
This place belongs to the same organization that owns the Days Inn capitol Hill In the Aztlan Sector. and thus is officially part of the same chain. A Santa Fe-based management company runs the Golden Days, however, and the difference shows. The Azzie capitol Hill establishment ls a good, solid, moderately priced hostelry; PuebSec's hotel oﬀers services you'd normally expect from a five-star outfit, but at three-star prices.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Hard Target|Hard Target]]
If you're looking for a seedy. no-nonsnse watering hole,look no further than Hard Target In Lakewood. A stone's throw from the Lakewodd Correctional lnstitutionn ("The Can") and not much further from the Fort Logan Medical Center ("The Asylum"), this dive attract a eclectic mix of patrons. Nowhere else we know of can you find oﬀ-duty correctional officers drowning their sorrows sitting next to Fort Logan outpatients who look like they're one step ahead of a tight-fitting canvas coat with long arms and lot of buckles

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Joe’s Drop Off|Joe’s Drop Off]]
A longtime runner hangout, this bar is also very popular with the local smuggling community. If you’re looking for a t-bird pilot, you’ll probably find one (or three) here. If you’re an Anglo, you might have a hard time, as the place still hasn’t shaken its Ute roots completely.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Lakewood Correctional Institute|Lakewood Correctional Institute]]
Part prison, part psych ward, all creepy. Experiments are done on their criminal wards, and they really push the ethical boundaries of what is considered “science” and what is considered “torture.” Their latest round of experiments focuses on BTL addiction. The lead researcher there, Dr. Richard Hutton, has a theory that if BTL was addictive enough, the addict would never need to seek out more. His theory is that this would cripple criminal enterprise, as the addicts would never need to commit crime to fuel the habit. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Lakewood FRTA Station|Lakewood FRTA Station]]
The FRTA is the arm of Ghostwalker’s Administration that is responsible for maintaining the subway system throughout the Demesne. In the past, these stations were run by different nations, but now they are all unified. These stations serve the purpose of providing a checkpoint for national sectors, as well as to change trains within the Demesne. Changing trains within the Demesne is a simple act that doesn’t require anything special. However, changing trains to or from a national sector requires additional screening.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Lakewood Tower|Lakewood Tower]]
The best place for upscale living in Lakewood. This 15-story tower supports the nearby businesses and boasts a few of its own as amenities. There are two restaurants, including one on the roof that provides spectacular views of both the Rocky Mountains and The Hub

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/Tablelands Restaurant|Tablelands Restaurant]]
Tablelands is an upscale but casual restaurant with a Southwester theme. It's not the kind of place you visit in suit and tie. but don't go there in leather and Do Martens, either. No official dress code exists as such, but the staﬀ will make it abundantly dear that you don't quite fit If you're not wearing a wardrobe that costs a couple of hundred nuyen. Once you overcome that obstacle, however, Tablelands is a wonderful place. The food Is topnotch Southwester cuisine, often with a twist. like rattlesnake In a light mango vinaigrette. A decent wine list and quiet music round out an atmosphere perfect for face-to-face discussions--either biz or romantic

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/The Raintree Inn|The Raintree Inn]]
Lakewood locals claim this used to be a comfortable, safe hostelry where you could get a clean room for a reasonable price. At least the price haven't changed. The Raintree seems to have fallen on bad times over the past few years. Apparently. cleaning and maintenance have reached an all-time low on the owner/manager's priority list. Go-gangers hang out In the back parking lot and get their yuks from hassling guests. and people lose all kinds of drek from lightfingers helping themselves into their rooms.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/The Rattlesnake Grill|The Rattlesnake Grill]]
If you like no-frills Southwester decor, friendly service, good food, and classic R&B, this is the place to hang. The tile ﬂoors and mock adobe walls make the place acoustically "live" and pretty fragging loud when the band's playing, but It's more popular as a place to eat, drink, and dance than talk. No dress code and everyone's welcome--corp suits, ganger-wannabes, middle-class wage-slaves. everyone. The cuisine Is Southwester. and the centerpiece of the menu is (surprise!) rattlesnake

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lakewood/ZDF Station Lakewood|ZDF Station Lakewood]]
The local headquarters for ZDF operations in the Lakewood district, this region is well known for having criminals who "disappear" while under custody. Rumor has it that any criminal who doesn't get a lawyer quickly may find themselves over at Lakewood Correctional Institute.
