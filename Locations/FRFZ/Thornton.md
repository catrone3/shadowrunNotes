A suburb of Denver in between Westminster and Brighton, Thornton was once managed by the Sioux and still retains some of that attitude. It’s not uncommon to see people openly carrying weapons of various styles, sizes, and lethality.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/Apex Plasmids Complex|Apex Plasmids Complex]]
Apex Plasmids is the largest food producer in the FREZ. They produce almost all the soy, mycoprotein, and algae used by the sprawl. As a result, they own huge swaths of land where they have hydroponic facilities. However, the side effect of all this production is the area around the Complex is just disgusting to smell. Thus, there are not many businesses in the area, other than Hardpan, the rough-and-tumble bar that serves many of the employees.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/Brighton Rose|Brighton Rose]]
Ignore the name. Nothing about this place is rosy. Sitting between the Apex Plasmids Complex and a sewage plant, the only advantage that the squats at Brighton Rose offers is that it’s close to Hardpan. If you visit or live here, bring a gas mask and some backup filters.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/Carnimore|Carnimore]]
This spot is part of a very popular chain of restaurants that cater to protein-rich diets and big appetites. The Carnimore franchise features a huge buffet specializing in meaty flavors and textures. They are tremendously successful in areas with heavy ork and troll populations, and the advertising reflects that. It’s not as obvious as places like the Big Rhino in Seattle, but it’s still pretty clear that this is where you can go if you have nine hungry kids and you’re on a budget. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/Fairview Heights|Fairview Heights]]
Fairview Heights is a gated community that ostensibly only allows former PCC residents to live there. Since Ghostwalker’s ouster of the PCC from Arvada, there are a number of homes in the community that are still owned by the PCC citizens, but stand unused. The PCC landlords are eager to rent these homes to people, in order to turn a profit off these properties.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/Hardpan|Hardpan]]
The only business willing to put itself close to the Apex Plasmids algae tanks, Hardpan has a long tradition of catering to the blue-collar workers in the area. The owner, a Sioux human named Susan “Banshee” Johnson, keeps a running list of those who get thrown out with pictures of their beaten faces hanging from the back of the bar like trophies.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/Northglenn Apartments|Northglenn Apartments]]
This area of Thornton is stereotypically Siouxan: xenophobic to outsiders, aggressively posturing, and no-nonsense blue-collar hard work is rewarded. The nearby apartment complex ensures that the residents have a cheap place to stay, even if it is spartan. Just don’t try to rent the place if you’re an Anglo.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/Shiawase Plaza|Shiawase Plaza]]
Headquarters to Shiawase operations in the FRFZ, the Plaza is a large campus spread out across a wide area. The buildings are arranged in such a way as to emphasize harmony between the various subsidiaries on the campus. Some of those subsidiaries include Arboritech, which focuses on agricultural products, Shiawase Fuzion, which provides power to Denver and much of the Zone, and Shiawase City Services, which provides infrastructure, water, and waste management solutions to Denver

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Thornton/The Buckhom|The Buckhom]]
The Buckhom now finds itself in the midst of a once-affluent residential district that hit the skids in a big way during the last decade. The decor seems deigned to make Anglos feel very uncomfortable. Artwork on the walls. computer-modified "historical" photographs, dioramas, plaques-all show the pre-European Amerind nations as the epitome of civilization and sophistication and demonize the "invaders" to a startling degree
