One of the largest districts, Elbert includes basically all the rural plains to the east of I-25 between Denver and Colorado Springs. There are nomadic “tribes” that wander the area, making camp wherever they want, and otherwise operating much like go-gangs. There’s not a lot of places that are permanently established, but if you can find one of those tribes, you may be able to get them to help smuggle you in or out of the Zone.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Elbert/Grassy Knoll Ranch|Grassy Knoll Ranch]]
Run by a dwarf named Jeb Johnson, the Grassy Knoll Ranch is one of the only horse ranches left in the area. It also has a unique side business of raising hellhounds. In addition to the monetary benefits, hellhounds have the benefit of keeping away horse thieves.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Elbert/Little Wolf Nursery|Little Wolf Nursery]]
Being in rural Elbert has some advantages. For instance, you can play around with Awakened plants without running the risk of creating a Fort Lupton situation. That’s basically what Luna Cochran decided to do when she opened up her nursery.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Elbert/ZDF Station Elbert|ZDF Station Elbert]]
Located in the small town of Elizabeth, the Elbert police station retains a lot of its rustic feel. The ZDF officers often refer to themselves as "sheriff" rather than "officer", and they even maintain a mounted horse division.
