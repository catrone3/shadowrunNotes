A small, low- to middle-class district on the eastern edges of the Hub, Lowry has been the beating heart of industry in Denver for more than a century. Formerly a US Air Force Base, the district has a reputation for hard work and steel grit. When the base was closed down, the mechanics and industrialists opened up other shops. As a result, the district has a reputation for breeding an affinity with machines.

In addition to all the blue-collar areas of Lowry, the southern tip of the district is known as Chinatown due to the abundance of Asian buildings and businesses in the area. Not large enough to qualify as a district on its own, Chinatown was lumped in with Lowry during the Reclamation. There’s a bit of racial tension as well, since the district is supposed to represent both groups, but fails to do so with equity.


## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Ascending Star|Ascending Star]]
Operated exclusively by the Golden Triangle Triad, and the pet project of Lodge Master Li Zicheng, the Ascending Star advertises that it caters to all the needs of any sarariman or traveling businessman. While sex is available if one desires, the primary purpose of the women is providing life coaching and guidance through one’s challenges. As you might have surmised, Li is using the facility to extract secrets and information from the businessmen and uses that information for blackmail or extortion.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Denver Shaolin Academy|Denver Shaolin Academy]]
Ostensibly a dojo that trains students in Shaolin Kung Fu, the Academy is operated by none other than Hu Yan Zhuo of the White Lotus Triad. Promising students are encouraged to join the White Lotus’ ranks. Many members of their triad have conducted extensive training here.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Happy Canyon Mall|Happy Canyon Mall]]
A gigantic shopping complex that offers almost every Asian good imaginable. The mall is jointly owned by the White Lotus and Golden Triangle triads and serves as a neutral ground for the two to meet up and discuss business. Inside the mall is the Temple of Inner Light, which can be used by either of the triads for religious purposes.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Happy Flower Apartments|Happy Flower Apartments]]
One of the better apartments in Chinatown, Happy Flower caters to well-to-do immigrants and those that want some discretion in their living conditions.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Klub Karma|Klub Karma]]
Formerly operated by the White Lotus triad, Klub Karma is currently run by the Casquilho family. While talking business is allowed there, violence is not. There are private rooms up on the second floor for discreet meetings. Getting access to one of the private rooms requires talking with the manager and convincing them to let you in. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Lowry FRTA Station|Lowry FRTA Station]]
The FRTA manages this station as a central hub for changing trains and routes. Its proximity to Lowry International Airport and The Hub makes it the busiest station outside of Union Station. This is also where one can board a train going to the UCAS sector of Front Range or to one of the CAS sectors.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Lowry International Airport|Lowry International Airport]]
Located near the site of the former Lowry Air Force Base, Lowry International is a small airport that, due to the small runway, is only rated to handle semi-ballistic, suborbital, and HSCT flights. There are also facilities for VTOL aircraft, such as helicopters and skycabs. Rumors say that there were missile silos buried under the facilities, along with a command-and-control bunker. No one has found evidence of these things, but the rumors persist.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Ming Solutions Office|Ming Solutions Office]]
The local office of Ming Solutions, a subsidiary of Wuxing. The researchers and geomancers in this office were responsible for coordinating the construction of Wuxing Cherry Park. Now that Cherry Park has been built, there was a concern that Ming would be moved to that new facility. However, it seems that Wuxing likes to keep some influence over Chinatown and will not be moving Ming Solutions any time soon.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Mystic Curiosities|Mystic Curiosities]]
A good talismonger is half crack researcher, half con man. It’s tough to make a good living simply with quality telesma—the competition for such goods is high, and the supply is tight. If a talismonger wants to make a living, they have to be willing to get people to overpay for some cheap crap.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Nu Shen Massage|Nu Shen Massage]]
A bunraku parlor that caters to the nearby corporate types from Centennial. Nu Shen is run by an elf (maybe?) named Da-xia “Daisy” Wu who keeps slotting herself into different bodies. One day she might be in the body of a human man, or another day she might be a troll woman. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Park Village|Park Village]]
This low-income apartment complex remains despite the threats from the Administration to close the place down. It’s barely capable of sustaining a minimum standard of living. Given the proximity to the Aurora Warrens, this is the best option for those who don’t want to risk their life just going to the Stuffer Shack.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Rusty’s Garage|Rusty’s Garage]]
Rusty is an old-timer in the former CAS sector. He’s got that thick Southern drawl that one might expect and is missing several teeth that he should have replaced years ago. He’s also missing one of his arms, which has been replaced by what can best be described as a self-built cyberarm. Regardless, Rusty is still the best mechanic in the sector, and his drones help him keep up with the workload.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Three Delights|Three Delights]]
Three Delights is a perennial favorite to find authentic cuisine from Taiwan and Hong Kong. The ex-pats who live in the surrounding Chinatown neighborhood flood this restaurant nightly. If you don’t speak Mandarin or Cantonese, you won’t get service. If you can slot a linguasoft at the least, the drunken noodles are worth the effort.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Wings Over the RockiesAir & Space Museum|Wings Over the RockiesAir & Space Museum]]
The Air & Space Museum has a long-standing history for excellence. They proudly display replica and original aircraft from almost every era of flight. Everything from classic propeller planes to modern t-birds and military aircraft of all kinds can be found here. None of it is functional anymore, but if you need a quiet place to have a meet that doesn’t seem super pretentious, this might be your ideal location.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/ZDF Station Lowry|ZDF Station Lowry]]
Getting assigned to the Lowry ZDF station is considered to be the ultimate retirement move in the ZDF. Generally the Lowry district is low on violent crime, and the police here generally focus on white collar criminal activity.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/ZDF Substation Chinatown|ZDF Substation Chinatown]]
While Chinatown isn't a district of its own, the Lowry division of the ZDF felt it necessary to assert its presence in the area with mostly Chinese-ethnic police forces, and to specialize in managing crimes related to the triads, such as smuggling, extortion, and trafficking.
