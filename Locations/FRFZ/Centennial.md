Centennial is the tech capital of the FRFZ and recently expanded to take over what was  
left standing of Englewood. More on that below. Here’s where you’ll find companies almost exclusively dedicated to the Matrix, with lots of little unranked corporations hoping to get gobbled up by one of the big guys. Centennial manages the University of Denver as well, which will be pouring out enough tech gurus to keep the area busy for decades to come.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Aegis Cognito Office|Aegis Cognito Office]]
One would expect that in a city like Denver, the world’s largest private spy organization would have an influence. Aegis Cognito has an openly observed office, and you should treat it like an embassy—it’s full of bureaucrats and spies, but you can’t tell which is which. While they might have some data on-site, it’s likely the kind that isn’t useful on its own. There is one person in the office who I know for a fact is a spy: Janice Valdes. It’s a complicated story, but basically, we used to spy on each other for our respective masters. We caught each other many times, and it sort of turned into a thing. I’ve got leverage on her, and I’m sure she’s got leverage on me, too. We respect each other, and I don’t go after her anymore.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Centennial Airport|Centennial Airport]]
One of the larger airports in the Zone, the Centennial Airport caters to corporate types. It’s not used for leisure travel, in part because it’s so far from touristy attractions. It’s located close to Castle Rock on the south end of Centennial and can support all kinds of aircraft. Some of the maintenance staff have a side gig where they’ll do work on your t-bird or whatever, putting it into an underused hangar. Just make sure that the corporate owner of that hangar doesn’t come back while the work is being done on it.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Chamberlain Airport|Chamberlain Airport]]
The second airport for the Centennial District, Chamberlain Airport is substantially smaller than Centennial Airport. It’s primarily a commuter hub for sky taxis, helicopters, and similar vehicles. Given its proximity to the university, it also sees some use from the richest corp kids going to school there. The airport cannot handle any kind of non-vertical takeoff or landing craft, but if you want to get a helicopter and need it quickly, this is the place to go

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Cherry Creek Country Club|Cherry Creek Country Club]]
Back in the day, Centennial was run by the CAS, and their … old-fashioned attitudes are still somewhat prevalent in the area. The Country Club is a bastion of racism and misogyny. For more than a century, it’s only allowed human men to play, and uses human women as trophies and waitstaff, exclusively. Not surprisingly, the nearby University of Denver won’t tolerate that kind of thing, and so protests are an increasingly common sight.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Drones, Drones, Drones!|Drones, Drones, Drones!]]
As the name suggests, this is the place to go if you need drones, drone parts, or advice on how to use your drone. They have bins full of parts, all of which are collected by drones and brought up to the counter. Their local riggers give great advice to anyone who has questions about which model can do what. Those same riggers will often provide after-hours support to people who are willing to pay a little extra, if you catch my meaning.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Free Zone Voice Offices|Free Zone Voice Offices]]
For those of you who might be a century old, I’ve heard of a thing called “public broadcast services” that used to be available to anyone and anywhere. The Free Zone Voice is modeled on that concept. They’re based out of the University of Denver, and they get by without a lot of ads or corporate sponsorships. As a result, they’re about the closest thing to a free and independent journalistic source in the Zone. Instead of focusing on investigative journalism, they prefer to work on what they call micro-news, deep dives on narrow topics, and frequently getting the voice of the common person on the street

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Lowry/Mystic Curiosities|Mystic Curiosities]]
A good talismonger is half crack researcher, half con man. It’s tough to make a good living simply with quality telesma—the competition for such goods is high, and the supply is tight. If a talismonger wants to make a living, they have to be willing to get people to overpay for some cheap crap. Zhang Wong, proprietor of Mystic Curiosities in Chinatown, has sold share of cheap crap in his time. Sometimes people use that to dismiss him, to label him as ignorant or a cheat. Ignoring him, though, means missing out on his considerable body of knowledge—and on the good stuff he occasionally has on display in his shop. The best way to get the good stuff when it goes on sale is not to just show up, browse, and hope. Cultivate Zhang, ask him advice, and pay him when he tells you something useful. Build up that relationship, show him he’s valued, and eventually you’ll get a call from him telling you that he’s got something in stock you may be interested in taking a look at

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Novatech Matrix Services Office|Novatech Matrix Services Office]]
This is yet another tech company that at one point found its way into NeoNET’s hands. Now it’s in the hands of Spinrad Global, but the future is extremely uncertain. Novatech made a bid following Ghostwalker’s Reclamation to provide services for the new public grid. That bid failed and made their dissolution a near certainty. Even though they are presenting a brave public face, the staff is jumping ship for other companies, such as Warpdrive.

Another one-time luxury hotel fallen on rough times, this establishment Is located In the heart of the Denver Tech Center. In long-gone days, Hyatt owned this place but sold oﬀ the TC (as the locals call It) to a local outfit before the Treaty of Richmond and the creation of the CAS Sector. The sale, of course. stipulated that the buyers drop the Hyatt name. A few years later. along came the Treaty of Richmond, and the hotel's owners suddenly found themselves In CAS territory...outside the Jurisdiction In which the agreement with the Hyatt chain held any water. The Ink had hardly dried on the Treaty of Richmond before the owners of the TC slapped the "Hyatt Regency" name back on the walls, signs, business cards, and stationery. The TC slid down the quality scale pretty fast. of course, which didn't do much to help the Hyatt chain's reputation worldwide. Predictably, the Hyatt chain pitched a dozen fits with no visible result-until a major shareholder In the local company died In a tragic accident. Son afterward, similar tragedies claimed the lives of two other key players. Before you can say "corporate Inﬂuence," down came the Hyatt name and the TC became the "Regency Tech Center.·

Though the Serpent's Feather is laid out like a restaurant and serve excellent f, its main claim to fame Is as a bar. It's a comfortable, somewhat upscale place. but It's still got the kind of subliminal energy that give any bar It spark. The sound system's always pumping out the latest shag and cyberrock smashes. but the acoustic make It possible to have a private conversation In the booths. Few shadowrunners seem to frequent "the Snake," but It's long been a favorite hangout for locals and various ﬂavors of fixers

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/Tech Center|Tech Center]]
The area along the boundary between the southeast of Denver proper and the suburb of Englewood picked up the name "Tech Center" before the turn of the century. Back then, It deserved the moniker. The original Denver Technological Center. off Intercity 25 a n d Belleview Avenue, was an Industrial park that attracted high-technology businesses, and by the turn of the century also served as a kind of incubator for start-ups. Over the years, the "Tech Center area· branched out from this original seed to cover ten other Industrial parks, several hotels. and countless support businesses. The Tech Center's fortunes began to decline when a fierce shake-out hit the high-tech Industry In 2012

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Centennial/The Tipsy Chip|The Tipsy Chip]]
One of the coolest bars I’ve ever been to is the Tipsy Chip. It’s built in a basement and very reminiscent of a British pub. It also has a strange collection of Aztlan trophies, supposedly liberated during the brief Aztlan occupation of the area. The owner is Papa Tepin, a hacker who is constantly tweaking the bar’s host. He holds nightly hackathons to see which hacker can put their tag on the host first. First one to hack it gets free drinks and bragging rights.

The oldest school in the region, the University of Denver has been in continuous operation since 1864. They grew to take over a whole chunk of Denver. Following Ghostwalker’s Reclamation and the preceding destruction of Englewood, the university area is now under the control of Centennial. Nominally, this means that subsidies are now more likely to come from tech companies than from old money, but it really hasn’t changed much. Housing is still an absolute nightmare, which has led to a bid by MCT to build a mini-arcology nearby. The university has yet to accept the bid.

The Wuxing, Inc. regional headquarters is finally constructed, after several attempts by rivals to sabotage it. With the support of their subsidiary, Ming Solutions, they have done a tremendous job of enhancing the natural landscape while expanding their buildings in a respectful way. The Cherry Park complex acts as the regional headquarters for the Malaysian Independent Bank and the Prosperity Development Corporation, both of which finance companies and startups in the region.
