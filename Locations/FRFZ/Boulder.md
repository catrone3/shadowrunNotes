Boulder is the northernmost city in the FRFZ. It’s a gorgeous place, truly. The residents there have done a lot to make the city environmentally friendly, even requiring new buildings to be built so that they don’t obstruct the landscape. This means there are fewer corporate buildings in the city, but the residents think that’s a worthwhile tradeoff. Home to one of the oldest universities in the region, Boulder produces some of the best artists and creative talents in North America.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Bear Creek Condos|Bear Creek Condos]]
Located just off the campus of the University of Colorado, the Bear Creek community has affordable housing that is often grabbed up by the nearby students. Because of the frequent turnover, it’s not unusual to be able to grab a townhouse or condo for a short stint without any questions being asked.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Boulder Maglev Station|Boulder Maglev Station]]
The northern edge of the north/south maglev route, the Boulder Maglev Station also connects with trains in and around the northern routes of the train network. From here, one can grab a train to almost any destination in Boulder as well.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Denver Data Haven Beta Site|Denver Data Haven Beta Site]]
Rumor has it that the Denver Data Haven had a contingency plan in case their old site on the Air Force Academy was compromised. That same rumor indicates that they maintained a “beta site” near the old National Center for Atmospheric Research. If there are survivors, and if the rumors are true, this is where the survivors would muster.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Fox Theatre|Fox Theatre]]
A favorite nightclub for students at the University of Colorado for generations, the Fox Theatre is a hint of retro cool in the midst of an ever-changing landscape. It specializes in jazz, indie rock, and even hosts a few poetry slams. An unspecified alum purchased the theatre back in 2068 and began retrofitting it to keep the aesthetic while modernizing the facilities. You’ll find AR-enabled elements throughout, carefully woven into the art deco styling of the building.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Halferville|Halferville]]
There is a small area on the eastern side of Boulder that is affectionately known as “Halferville.” It supports a large community of dwarves, and they lean hard into their communal identity. Every week they host a farmer’s market where you can buy dwarven-made arts and crafts, among other things, and generally participate in what they refer to as “Halfer culture.” By which I mean, everything is basically normal, but the prices are inflated in order to bilk the tourists.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Heritage Museum|Heritage Museum]]
Back before the Ute Nation was absorbed by the PCC, Boulder was in the Ute sector. The region boasts a tremendous amount of historical Ute sites and artifacts, most of which are housed in the Heritage Museum. The Heritage Museum also caters to other types of exhibits though, but they try to remain mainstream. For instance, you won’t see a single image of Daniel Howling Coyote here, because he’s considered too “edgy.”

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Horizon/Horizon Office Complex|Horizon Office Complex]]
Depending on how you approach this building, you might see the plains to the east or the mountains out west. That’s because Horizon built this facility with unique exterior panels that mimic the surrounding environment. Designed to curve and move with the landscape, this office is truly an architectural marvel. Rumor has it that this office houses a branch of Horizon Internal Intelligence, their own gestapo that monitors internal employees for the Consensus. If true, this might be a gold mine for an intrepid interloper who wanted to get their hands on data about Horizon assets.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Nederland|Nederland]]
Nederland is a rural community on the outer edges of the Golden district. When the region was run by the Ute Nation the community was a group of outsiders. They were more utilitarian than the rest of the Ute culture, partly due to the harshness of being so far from urban niceties. The tribal dictatorship of the Ute culture also bred a degree of resentment among the Nederland community, who just wanted to be left to their own devices.  

#### [[../../AA Corps/DocWagon/Nightingale Hospital|Nightingale Hospital]]
Nightingale has a reputation for servicing any customer that comes along, if they can pay the bill. They have contracts with DocWagon and CrashCart to provide service to their customers in the area. This hospital also serves as a research hospital, providing cutting edge medical techniques and training to future doctors.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/Niwot Airport|Niwot Airport]]
Niwot was the former Ute sector airport. It previously served as the Boulder municipal airport until the Ute government expanded it so they could have their own airport. When the PCC took over the Ute sector, arguments were made that it should be closed down, mostly because Sedalia was already underutilized, but former Ute government officials made a case for it being retained. For a while it was used primarily for ZDF and corp flights, with only a token service to other former Ute airports. However, with Horizon making serious investments in Boulder and a major university campus opening, the airport has been brought up to PCC standards, with a Horizon terminal built just to handle their traffic, the civilian airport refurnished, and additional flights added to the rebuilding University of Colorado, as well as the universities supporting that reconstruction.

#### [[../../A Corps/Spiritech/SpiriTech Headquarters|SpiriTech Headquarters]]
The worldwide headquarters for SpiriTech, located in Boulder. Due to SpiriTech’s large number of employed spirits and shamans, this building has some interesting architecture. SpiriTech hired Ming Solutions to provide them with guidance on how to handle the spirit employees’ special needs. The result is a building that has no living material on the sides of the building. This allows spirits to wander in and out at their leisure. Additionally, the building has living material in the walls, which preserves the privacy of those inside the building.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado Boulder]]
The University of Colorado recently underwent massive reforms and rebuilding efforts, thanks in large part to the University of Denver. While some might view this as aiding a rival, the universities both saw that there was greater potential in preserving that rivalry than in stifling the competition. The University of Colorado draws substantial numbers of magically active students and has a burgeoning technomancy department that studies the effects of Resonance.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Boulder/ZDF Station Boulder|ZDF Station Boulder]]
The very large Boulder district has a correspondingly large ZDF presence. ZDF operations are run out of this building, which is adjacent to some of the district's administration facilities.
