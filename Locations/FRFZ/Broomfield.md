This cozy district just northwest of Denver’s city center boasts some of the nicest real estate in the region. It’s a well-to-do district, with many corporate enclaves. Per-capita income is on the high end for the FRFZ, and as a result they tend to have lower ZDF response times, lower crime rates, higher education rates, etc. All the things that privilege and money can buy can be found in Broomfield.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Broomfield/Cerebrotech Factory|Cerebrotech Factory]]
A subsidiary of [[../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]], Cerebrotech focuses heavily on cyberware components. This factory produces most of them for their [[../../AAA Corps/Ares|Ares]] Consumer Goods division.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Broomfield/HyperSense Headquarters|HyperSense Headquarters]]
Back in the early 2060s, Renraku bought out this homegrown simsense tech company and made it one of their subsidiaries. Since then, Renraku has regularly pumped out upgrades to their simsense technology, constantly pushing boundaries and opening up new avenues of sensation. They owe it all to the work done in this building.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Broomfield/Newlife Medical|Newlife Medical]]
A top-notch medical facility in Denver, Newlife Medical has contracts with the ZDF to provide them with upgrades, implants, and medical services at a discounted rate. Thus, the security at Newlife is always better than one would expect, since there are so many officers that literally owe their lives to the doctors there. If you can get in, expect to be treated well and to have excellent service. But know this: they have been known to send off-duty ZDF officers to collect on those that fall behind in their payments.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Broomfield/Town Center Mall|Town Center Mall]]
Despite the fact that malls lost their mainstream popularity over a century ago, the Towne Center Mall remains open and busy at most times of the day. Perhaps there’s something that rich people like about being able to touch the goods before they buy them? Rumor has it that the mall’s owners are deeply in debt and are on the verge of closing their doors for good. But for now, busy parents can find respite by spending their nuyen on vapid shopping experiences.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Broomfield/ZDF Station Broomfield|ZDF Station Broomfield]]
Like its namesake district, the Broomfield division of the ZDF tends to be more relaxed than most police forces. Because of Broomfield's primarily white-collar population and reputation as a commuter district, the ZDF here focus more on smaller offenses, such as ordinance violations and petty crimes.
