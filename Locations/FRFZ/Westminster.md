The final district in our tour of the Zone, Westminster is a small suburban area just north and west of the Hub. As busy as the Hub is, it sometimes spills over into Westminster. As a result, the ZDF here are always vigilant, and you’ll rarely find more aggressive police.

## Geographic Notes
#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Westminster/Estancia|Estancia]]
Estancia is the name of one of the busiest neighborhoods in Arvada. Originally a “master-planned” community for the sleepy bedroom district, its proximity to The Hub and Lakewood have made the area more densely populated than anyone planned. The neighborhood boasts a few restaurants and bars and a police station that is manned by ZDF forces.

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Renraku/Iris Firmware Office|Iris Firmware Office]]
The Denver office for this Renraku subsidiary, Iris Firmware focuses on developing new software to operate cybernetic components. If you’re using some sort of optic cyberware, there’s a good chance the software was developed here. Iris is the leading supplier of software and firmware for optical devices. 

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Westminster/Mountain Meadows Apartments|Mountain Meadows Apartments]]
This is a family-oriented apartment complex that offers simple accommodations at a fair price. The property managers did splurge a bit and bought a nice heated communal pool, complete with a water slide (only available in the summer) and a rock grotto for privacy.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Westminster/Native American Broadcast Service (NABS)|Native American Broadcast Service (NABS)]]
One of the oldest media outlets in the area, the NABS is well-known for its hard-hitting investigative journalism. They’re also considered to be extremely fair, and they protect their sources well, which means if someone’s going to get a scoop on a story that might cause damage to someone’s political ambitions, NABS is going to be that someone.  

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Westminster/Northern Lights Enchanting|Northern Lights Enchanting]]
Northern Lights is run by a very large man with one eye who I swear thinks he’s the embodiment of Odin. He goes by Northman, and he even has a raven familiar named Huginn. He claims the other one, Muninn, is away and up to no good. Despite the fact that Northman follows the Norse tradition a bit too literally, his work is absolutely top-notch. He can enchant nearly anything, but he excels at rune work and qi foci.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Westminster/Rattlesnake Grill|Rattlesnake Grill]]
The Rattlesnake Grill is a family-friendly southwestern food restaurant. The food is quite good, which keeps it high on the list for locals and tourists. While a family-friendly restaurant may not seem like a good place for a meet, the number of eyes around you will ensure that everything stays friendly.

#### [[../../Corps (Local)/FRFZ/Westminster/The Ugly|The Ugly]]
The trio of arcotowers that sprouted up in the 2070s are colloquially known as “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.” The tower in Arvada is known as “The Ugly” in part because it could have been good, but turned sour really quickly. Part of the reason why the Ugly became so awful has to do with its history.
