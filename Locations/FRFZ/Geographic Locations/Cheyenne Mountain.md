#Denver 
Formerly the home of the US military’s NORAD division, the Cheyenne Mountain installation is a massive honeycomb of tunnels and elevator shafts. No one knows just how deep into the mountain the complex goes. It has lain abandoned since the First Treaty of Denver, but recently people in the nearby areas have been going missing, and conspiracy theorists think that something in the Cheyenne Mountain is kidnapping people.  

> The fae I’ve talked with have all suggested that Cheyenne Mountain could be a hot spot for the Unseelie Court. If that’s the case, I expect we’ll see some work to go in there and apprehend or eliminate the threat. But as with all things involving the fae, be careful who you trust and what you say.
