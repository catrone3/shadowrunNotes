The Dragon’s Den may or may not be a real hyper-metaplane. Rumor has it that this is where Ghostwalker spends most of his time when he visits. People who claim to have visited and returned say that it’s a massive mountain inhabited almost entirely by dwarves. They also talk about fantasy things that we’ve never seen before, like people made of rock and oddly flamboyant lizard people. I’ve never met someone who went there, so all the information I’ve ever learned about this place is from associates of associates. And naturally, they went missing some time later. All this lends credence to the idea that this place may be real. 

> Lately, the Denver Metaplane has started to show some very odd behavior. We know the hyper-metaplanes can be a pain to traverse due to their fractured nature, but now I’m seeing gates appearing, with people walking in and out. I have no idea where the gates are going, and I have no idea who these people are (or even if they are people) but it’s got me, and my spirits, pretty freaked out.”

> Those sound a lot like the gateways used by the fae to traverse their realms. I mean, the magical ability to traverse metaplanes and hyper-metaplanes via a gateway isn’t unique to the fae. In fact, I’d posit that the traversal between the hyper-metaplanes in Denver operate on a similar concept.
