The Black Canyon is one of the oldest of the hyper-metaplanes. It appears to be a massive primordial forest, with trees that block out the sky. The trees hold untold dangers but also unknowable possibilities. Looking into the dark, you might notice a dozen or more eyes staring back at you from the depths. Those eyes may be a trick of the light or some of the predators that stalk the Black Canyon. One does not go into the Black Canyon lightly, because it represents the isolationist ideologies of the regionâ€™s inhabitants. As a result, the denizens of the Black Canyon will not come to your aid. Ever.
