One of the more interesting hyper-metaplanes is called the City of Steel. It’s undergone a lot of changes since Ghostwalker kicked everyone out of the FRFZ. It used to be a mirror of Denver itself, segregated into different sectors, each similar to their real-world counterparts. But like the real world, the sectors are all gone now, run by a single unified entity called the Authority. In the City of Steel, the denizens have all their decisions made for them by the Authority. Free will is an illusion here, but it’s a well-crafted illusion.
