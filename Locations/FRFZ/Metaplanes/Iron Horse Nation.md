The Iron Horse Nation is a land that looks like something from an old post-apocalyptic action trid. Take the wild-west attitude of Denver, with all the ferocity and intensity that entails, and then give that attitude guns and vehicles of destruction. The region is choked with black smoke from chugging engines and the landscape is riddled with the discharged brass of millions of rounds of ammunition. Gangs rove the area on motorcycles, cars, and even in t-birds. They attack each other, fighting over scant resources such as water, bullets, and fuel. No one knows where the resources come from, but they are always replenished in just enough supply to keep the violence at a consistent levelâ€”enough to keep things going, but not enough to that things spiral out of control.
