A desolate, near-empty region of grey rock and sand, the Shattered Lands are a depressing simulacrum of reality. The landscape is dotted with communities all inspired by events, people, and places from Denver’s past. Some of these communities might represent the gold- and silver-rush mining towns, others might represent small enclaves of Amerind tribes, and I’ve seen one that looked like a small Aztec community, which I’ve noticed has grown over the years. The Shattered Lands are both empty and full of promise. While the region is relatively lawless and chaotic, it’s also full of potential and possibility. One can find opportunity here, if one knows how to forge it.
