Little Haiti is the major Haitian ethnic enclave, and metahumans of all types tend to live here, as long as they share a common Haitian ancestry and speak Haitian creole fluently. Non-Haitians aren't excluded, but it may be difficult to find anyone who speaks your language.   
  
Approximately 120,000 residents.   
  
This area is rating C and D. Infrequent patrols and poorly maintained PanicButton booths mean that crime here is reported less often and therefore enforced less often. The security services in these areas make no real effort to prevent crimes before they happen.
