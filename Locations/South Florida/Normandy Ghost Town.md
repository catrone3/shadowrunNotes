The Seven Storms hurricane season devestated sections of the city, and while most of Miami Beach was well protected, the least developed area was horribly flooded. Large apartment complexes and aging buildings collapsed or left residents trapped. Thousands of people died and the area has a high magical background to this day. Spirits or all sorts manifest unbidden.  
  
Knight Errant Security has specially trained forces to keep the area under control, and researchers often go in to study the magical events.Â   
  
Many local reagent hunters sneak into the area as magical regents appear here as if - well, by magic.  
  
Security is rating Z. Law enforcement is unlikely to respond to anything which happens here unless it threatens outside areas, or while accompanying researchers.
