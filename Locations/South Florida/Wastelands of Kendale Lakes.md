Badly damaged and flooded by the Seven Storms season, this region has never been rebuilt or drained. Sea level rise means that salt water bubbles up through the deep quarry lakes right through the limestone bedrock. The remains of suburban development rot in a shallow, wet grave. Municipal services and law enforcement are practically non-existent. Fresh drinking water cannot be easily obtained, as the water table is saline. Some businesses operate here, selling food, water, and survival supplies to locals.

E Rating security. This area is considered a slum. Security will respond if the victim has a SIN and calls in a complaint himself, or if the violence makes the headlines or threatens to spill over into more “important” areas.
