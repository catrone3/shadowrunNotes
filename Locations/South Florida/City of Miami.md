The City of Miami proper has a wide variety of apartments and condos available, but detached single family homes are a thing of the past. Culturally and ethnically diverse, the city functions and has mostly rebuilt from the storms nearly two decades ago.   
  
Population: 1.4 million.  
  
Rating A area mostly. Law enforcement in these areas is basically a call-and-response system. This means there are actually a lot of PanicButton booths and neighborhood watch groups and other organizations willing to call in at the slightest hint of criminal activity.
