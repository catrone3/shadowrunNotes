The City of Miami proper has a wide variety of apartments and condos available, but detached single family homes are a thing of the past. Culturally and ethnically diverse, the city functions and has mostly rebuilt from the storms nearly two decades ago.Â   
  
Population: 1.4 million.  
  
Rating A area mostly. Law enforcement in these areas is basically a call-and-response system. This means there are actually a lot of PanicButton booths and neighborhood watch groups and other organizations willing to call in at the slightest hint of criminal activity.

## Geographic Notes

#### Holiday Enchanted Forest

What was once a seasonal Christmas themed amusement park has transformed into a sprawling amusement park with rides and entertainments themed with all holidays and events from many cultures. Ride the Arbor Day Splash! Fry bread is two for one on Green Corn Day! See the fabulous colors of Holi and get one random bag of color powder for free with entry!  
  
Crowds are usually joyful, but occasional fights break out when when religious or cultural holidays offend people. - Columbus Day themed events were changed to "Native People's Day" decades ago, for example.

#### Little Havana

With Cuba the dominant economy of the region, this Cuban majority community is a thriving business hub. Businesses here speak English, Spanish, Creole, Sperethiel, French, Portuguese, German, and Dutch, either through language training or linguasoft implants. Multilingual retail employees are always in high demand and can assist you via telepressence if a fluent speaker for your native language cannot be found on location.

#### The Splendiferous Omniplex

What a wondrous place this should have been? The ridiculous idea of an oligarch, now a rotting diamond-shaped flophouse full of druggies, sad sacks, and the usual detritus of non-metahuman society.
