Originally built as a relief center to house, feed, and provide medical care to the victims of the Seven Storms hurricane season of 2061, this area is one of several unofficial "Ork towns" where law enforcement is non-existent and orks and trolls are practically forced to live by discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. SIN checks are required for anyone attempting to leave. The streets are choked with over a decade of debris, trash, and shacks. Any ground vehicle larger than a motorcycle cannot drive here.  
  
Population figures are essentially impossible to determine due to most residents having no official legal status. Estimated population 300,000.  
  
E Rating security. This area is considered a slum. Security will respond if the victim has a SIN and calls in a complaint himself, or if the violence makes the headlines or threatens to spill over into more “important” areas.
