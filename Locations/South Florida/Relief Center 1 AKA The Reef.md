Originally built as a relief center to house, feed, and provide medical care to the victims of the Meistersinger Massacre, this area is one of several unofficial "Ork towns" where law enforcement is non-existent and orks and trolls are practically forced to live by discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. SIN checks are required for anyone attempting to leave. The streets are choked with over a decade of debris, trash, and shacks. Any ground vehicle larger than a motorcycle cannot drive here.  
  
Population figures are essentially impossible to determine due to most residents having no official legal status. Estimated population 300,000.  
  
E Rating security. This area is considered a slum. Security will respond if the victim has a SIN and calls in a complaint himself, or if the violence makes the headlines or threatens to spill over into more “important” areas.

## Geographic Notes

#### Black Lung Club

A bunraku Yakuza sex club, where all the sex workers have their brains wired so that their personalities can be altered by their handler to meet the desires of customers. No one works here willingly.

#### Bus Terminal Ruin

This bus terminal is full of rusting hulks of obsolete vehicles. One would think it's a great place for scavengers and squatters, but locals avoid it, claiming it is haunted.

#### Franklin Building Maker Space

A pay-by-the minute maker space run by a commune of squatters. Plenty of locals come here to fabricate necessities they cannot purchase.

#### Goumen Kay Fight Club

A set of homes and yard encircled by high makeshift walls with a few entrances guarded by bouncers and gangers at all times, this compound is a training facility and exhibition hall for illegal fighting matches. Sometimes metahumans are pitted bare knuckle against one another, but often there are battles royale, and even fights between critters. Critter versus metahuman fights attract the biggest crowds.

#### Merciless Ming's

A string of fast food stalls line the way to and from the checkpoint and hospital to the South East, most of which are owned by the same ork entrepreneur, Merciless Ming.

#### Reef Bazaar

Cars are rare in the Reef. This stretch of road  has become an open air market in what was once a four lane street. Gangs compete for the right to extort protection money from the vendors.

#### Scrap Hills

Heaps of electronic trash, scrap metal, broken glass, and industrial waste are piled up to 30 meters high. Hosts of squatters and scavengers live here, some picking through trash to resell components.  
  
This is one of the most common ways in and out of The Reef, but is a hazardous journey through disused sewage pipes, tunnels cut through mountains of trash, and gutted buildings.

#### VA Medical Center

This facility has been converted many times in its existence. No longer a teaching hospital, it has no central authority, and hundreds of different grey and black market medical shops have opened in the corridors of this building. Open any door, and you might find a street doc installing cyberware, a squatter family, or a dark secret you won't live to share.
