The megacorporation NeoNET runs a trading center and Matrix security hub in this area. Electronic components are flown in, delivered direct from airplanes, modified, assembled, and sent back out. Technically anyone can do business here without paying handling fees, taxes, or duties. However, NeoNET owns the entire infrastructure and makes back a bit of money from rents and leases.  
  
Security Rating D. Infrequent patrols and poorly maintained PanicButton booths mean that crime here is reported less often and therefore enforced less often. The security services in these areas make no real effort to prevent crimes before they happen.
