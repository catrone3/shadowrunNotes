This private extraterritorial Ares megacorp island represents the pinnacle of luxurious living in the Caribbean. It also contains fabulous shopping for the wealthy, and is a mandatory port of call for cruise ships. Ares maintains a private cargo port, private cruise ship port, private airport, and if rumors are to be believed, a private military. The architectural style is semi-Roman, though glass is an abundantly used material, so most buildings are either gleam in white paint, or gleam with glass.Â  Rumors that Ares sells everything from arms to boats and VTOL aircraft in a greymarket here are totally unfounded, according to Ares public relations officers.
