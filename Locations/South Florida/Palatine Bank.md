This private extraterritorial Ares megacorp mass of Stilt Structures represents the pinnacle of luxurious living in the Caribbean. It also contains fabulous shopping for the wealthy, and is a mandatory port of call for cruise ships. Ares maintains a private cargo port, private cruise ship port, private airport, and if rumors are to be believed, a private military. The architectural style is semi-Roman, though glass is an abundantly used material, so most buildings are either gleam in white paint, or gleam with glass.  Rumors that Ares sells everything from arms to boats and VTOL aircraft in a greymarket here are totally unfounded, according to Ares public relations officers.  
  
Population: 12,000  
  
Security is rating AAA, representing the highest quality law enforcement and response time money can buy.

*This was originally going to be a floating city. However the Meistersinger Massacre beached the craft. The floats got buried in the ground and is more expensive to remove than just try again. So instead of letting it go to waste Ares turned into a luxury get away and safe zone

## Geographic Notes

#### Space Command Ares Miami, SCAM

Ares Macrotechnology conducts regular commercial space exploitation and has built an entire space facility in the water. Failed launches splash harmlessly into the water, or Bimini, which is close enough.
  
Ares space exploitation is not entirely peaceful. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0bcRCCg01I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0bcRCCg01I)
