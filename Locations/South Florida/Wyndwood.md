This is as much as many tourists will see of the Miami Sprawl, most never even catching sight of the Ork Town between the airport and the art district. This area is filled almost entirely with upscale galleries, artists workshops, and restaurants.  
  
Lone Star provides extremely tight security (rating AA) and drives away riffraff during "Art Walk" events that bring the rich and famous to Miami, but at other times the area is almost dead (rating B). There are innumerable bars, popup businesses, art installations, and all manner of temporary things to see and do. The people who live nearby have to contend with horrible traffic.  
  
Security is rating B which is usual for areas comprised primarily of commercial properties rather than residential, such as industrial parks, office complexes and suburban manufacturing.

## Geographic Notes

#### Bacardi Building

This compound contains two former office buildings for Bacardi Imports now deemed historical landmarks.  
  
It is often rented as space for artists and temporary gallery exhibits.

#### Edgewater Relief docks

Originally built as a temporary dock for relief work during the aftermath of the Meistersinger Massacre, this area has become a minor shipping hub and marina, where official supervision is quite lax.

#### Midtown Shops

A veritable island of familiar franchise commercial serenity this is highest traffic part of Wynwood. Expect to be bombarded with advisement and people from all walks of life, locals and tourists alike. Violence is swiftly dealt with by Lone Star security, but as long as your ID passes a cursory inspection and you have money to spend, everyone is welcome. [[../../AAA Corps/Horizon|Horizon]] is the landlord for the entire mall.

#### Stuffer Shack Grande

The ubiquitous all-in-one convenience store chain (wholly owned by [[../../AAA Corps/Aztechnology|Aztechnology]]) has a vast old fashioned everything store in this location. Middle class commuters pour in from all directions, guided here by their autopiloted vehicles for the best deals on bulk commodities. The proliferation of autopiloting means that many shoppers only have a vague idea of where this store is, and would be repulsed to learn of its proximity to The Reef. More upscale customers have their supplies automatically delivered.
