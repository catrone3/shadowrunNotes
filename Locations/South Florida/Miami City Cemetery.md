Having expanded well beyond its former borders during the clean-up from everything from the VITAS plague to the Seven Storms, the cemetery has been given up to ghouls.

For now, Lone Star security merely keeps things relatively contained. To conserve resources they mostly look the other way when the living sneak in and out.Â
