Having expanded well beyond its former borders during the clean-up from everything from the VITAS plague to the Seven Storms, the cemetery has been given up to ghouls. This is the oldest cemetery in the city, but by no means the only one. A purge of the ghouls inhabiting the tombs has been attempted numerous times, but it never seems to be enough. For now, Lone Star security merely keeps things relatively contained. To conserve resources they mostly look the other way when the living sneak in and out.Â   
  
This area is rating Z. Walls and other barriers keep the undesirables inside. Law enforcement is unlikely to respond to anything which occurs inside.

## Geographic Notes

#### Temple Israel

This Jewish temple was used as a clinic and refugee center during the recovery from the Seven Storms Season, but the temple was overrun by ghouls and efforts recover the location have failed.

#### Tuttle Memorial

Miami is the only major American city founded by a woman, Julia Tuttle. Her tomb is nearby, and a small memorial can be found here.
