One of the few public beaches and natural spaces open to the public, massive crowds congregate here on holidays. Visitors are asked to leave at sundown.Â   
  
Security is rating D. Infrequent patrols and poorly maintained PanicButton booths mean that crime here is reported less often and therefore enforced less often. The security services in these areas make no real effort to prevent crimes before they happen.  
  
By nightfall security is downgraded to rating E.
