High walls and full time security protect the high class residents of this desirable neighborhood. Once almost exclusively Latino, it now merely bars ork and troll residents quite openly. Middle and high class living is assured for anyone wealthy and human. Elves and dwarves are barely tolerated. When walking through this neighborhood one can almost be forgiven for imaging they have been transported back to the late twentieth century, a conservative image deliberately cultivated.  
  
Population: 170,000.Â   
  
Security is rating AA. Patrols cover the area 24 hours a day, but are less frequent than AAA. Astral patrols take place on an irregular schedule, and there may not be a security rigger system set up. Drones and spirits may guard certain areas in place of humans. Response is prompt.

## Geographic Notes

#### Juvenile Lockup

Private Lockup for "Under 21." In practice orks and trolls are locked up here, along with anyone under 21 who does not get transfered out of the Reef for forced agricultural labor, the most common sentence for felonies.
