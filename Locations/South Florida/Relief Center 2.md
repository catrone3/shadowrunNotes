Originally built as a relief center to provide services to the survivors of the Seven Storms Hurricane Season of 2061, this is one of several "Ork Towns" in the area where law enforcement is more concerned with keeping poverty and crime contained than under control. Orks and trolls aren't officially prohibited from most surrounding municipalities, but the discrimination against unregistered persons coupled with discrimination against orks and trolls means that most Miami trolls and orks live in these centers.   
  
Relief Center 2 functions, more or less, as an anarchist commune with community meetings and plenty of people sneaking out to poach meat from the Everglades, as well as exploiting smugglers, mercenaries, and other shadow economies.  
  
Estimated population 100,000-200,000.  
  
E Rating security. This area is considered a slum. Security will respond if the victim has a SIN and calls in a complaint himself, or if the violence makes the headlines or threatens to spill over into more “important” areas.
