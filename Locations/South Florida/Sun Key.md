Purchased in 2052 by Aztechnology, this island (Brickell Key) was considered a white elephant by stockholders until the architectural plans were revealed. With only 1 meter of elevation its once admired skyscrapers had become unsustainable by the mid 21st century, but the corp took on the engineering challenge of building in the loose sediment of the bay. Work began quickly on a tetrahedral arcology which seemed to rise directly from the water and residents moved in during late 2063 after work was delayed by the Seven Storms disaster of 2061. At 800 meters tall, it is the largest building in Miami by far, but 82% of its volume is dedicated to a multilevel, biodiverse tropical greenhouse and an Aztec style sun pyramid. The remaining space is estimated to house nearly 20,000 residents.
