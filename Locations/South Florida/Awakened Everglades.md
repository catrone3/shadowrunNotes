The Everglades includes pinewoods on slightly elevated land, brackish coastal mangrove forests, hardwood tropical hammocks, sloughs, and vast shallow swaths of impenetrable sawgrass. In the Sixth World, the Everglades has not only recovered, but thrives. The ecology changes so often in places that many people suspect magical forces at work. The area is filled with diverse creatures, mundane and magical alike.  
  
This is a W zone, classified as complete wildness. Security forces will not come to your aid though border patrols, pirates, smugglers, coyotes, poachers, hunters, and others might menace you.

## Geographic Notes

#### Dinosaur Sightings

Rumors swirl around Lake Okeechobee of awakened dinosaurs. Many missing persons reported. To date, no evidence has been found to support these claims.

#### Everglades Alligator Farm

Some tourists come by to see people feed and wrestle alligators, but most of this area is a farm for thousands of gators raised for meat and leather.

#### HM69 Nike Missile Base

A former american missile base this location consists of 22 remaining buildings and the remains of a military operation.Â   
  
Groups of survivalists and squatters have made this a trading hub for those who try to live deep in the Everglades.

#### Krome Prison

Once a holding and processing center for corrections and immigration for the old U.S.A, this immense prison complex runs right along the Everglades border. It is said that escaping into the awakened wetlands is tantamount to suicide, though it's unclear whether it's the natural hazards, magical critters, or tribal border patrols that make the prospect of escape to the west so unlikely to succeed.  
  
There is unanimous agreement among jailbirds that escape into the Miccosukee resort across the street is impossible. The security there is extremely vigilant and well armed.

#### Miccosukee Resort and Gaming

The Miccosukee tribe, while more traditional than their Seminole allies and cousins, maintain a thriving resort and gaming hall which functions as an extraterritorial embassy. They host frequent hunting expeditions for Everglades critters from this location. On occasion hunting guides have been hired as bounty hunters by the Krome Prison to hunt down escapees.

#### Snakes!

It had to be. The good news is that native snake species rarely bother people. The bad news is that exotic snakes are now extremely common in the Everglades, as well as magical reptiles never seen before the 21st century.
