## Geographic Notes

#### Robert is Here

The idiosyncratically named farmer's market is the biggest in the region and brings in legitimate suppliers from all across the region. The surrounding area is farmland as far as the eye can see, except for the sprawl to the east, a rare fertile region in this age. Reportedly, the business is named after the founder's fruit stand. As a boy he sold fruit at an intersection and held the sign "Robert is here." When he went home he put up a sign reading "Robert is not here."
