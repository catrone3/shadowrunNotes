Cheap thrills, including gambling, clean beaches, and "fancy" franchise restaurants form the heart of the Hollywood economy, a Florida getaway for people not wealthy enough to vacation on Miami Beach. The coastal areas are where the action is, while inland areas are sleepy suburbs with small, late 20th century apartment buildings. The guideblogs call it "quaint," locals call it "dingy."    
  
Security is rating C and D. Infrequent patrols and poorly maintained PanicButton booths mean that crime here is reported less often and therefore enforced less often. The security services in these areas make no real effort to prevent crimes before they happen.   
  
Population: 270,000  
  
Coastal business and residences have higher rating security, expect rating B.
