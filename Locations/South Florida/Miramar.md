Sleepy suburbs full of working wageslaves, franchise restaurants, and prefabricated cheapness. Entire neighborhoods are wholly owned housing associations run by specific megacorpoations as housing for their own employees. Low to middle class housing is available for conformist and obedient workers. A fate worse than death.   
  
Approximately 190,000 residents.   
  
Rating A area mostly. Law enforcement in these areas is basically a call-and-response system. This means there are actually a lot of PanicButton booths and neighborhood watch groups and other organizations willing to call in at the slightest hint of criminal activity.
