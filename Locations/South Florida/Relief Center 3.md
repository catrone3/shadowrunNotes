The northernmost and largest of the relief centers built after the Seven Storms Hurricane Season of 2061, this area had become chronically flooded and unsafe by then, as ranch styles homes sank into crumbling foundations. At the time this was the only area available for a refugee camp in the north. It was once an expensive suburb with million dollar homes. Today squatters and gangs run this area, living in the ruins of early 21st century mansions.  
  
Population estimated at 300,000.  
  
E Rating security. This area is considered a slum. Security will respond if the victim has a SIN and calls in a complaint himself, or if the violence makes the headlines or threatens to spill over into more “important” areas.

## Geographic Notes

#### Pits

Illegal dumping takes place on a continuous basis as trucks drive on the overpass over the flooded refugee camp and offload waste, often just idly chucked over the highway onto refugees or dropped by airship drones going on 24 hour circuits.   
  
Many residents make a living combing through the trash for reusable parts and materials, but huge areas are full of refuse from the residents to the south

#### Statue of Major Lauderdale

A bronze equestrian statue, and a common focus for gatherings in this refugee camp. Most gatherings here are anti-government, anti-corporate, and often a locus for gang conflicts.
