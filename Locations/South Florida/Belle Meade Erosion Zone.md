Seawalls have gone up in much of the city to fight rising sea levels, but this section of the city's coast was irreparably undermined by the 2050's. The Belle Meade Seawall was erected just to the west to protect the rest of this city, while this area has been left to decay. Smugglers and squatters of all types exploit this neglected strip of the city. Utility services haven't functioned here for decades. What squatters inhabit these ruins live off the grid. Services are almost non-existent.   
  
Population: Fewer than 90,000.  
  
E Rating security. This area is considered a slum. Security will respond if the victim has a SIN and calls in a complaint himself, or if the violence makes the headlines or threatens to spill over into more “important” areas.

## Geographic Notes

#### American Legion Hall
Good soldiers die for a cause, great ones grow old. With the advent of cybertechnology and magic, old soldiers get older and still don't die. This is the base for a group of Legionnaires who won't give up. Heavily armed, very experienced, but aged, they hold down an old American Legion Hall and a couple of blocks in every direction. The heat doesn't own this place, soldiers do.

#### Plagues of Mosquitoes
This area is intensely plagued by unusually large and dangerous insects. Standing water and abandoned places are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other biting insects. Some of those found here are unknown to science.

#### San Souci Towers
Megatowers built for middle class residents nearly fifty years ago right on the water, the ground floors are now entirely flooded and a hierarchy of vicious gangs and squatters remain.

#### Siren's Rocks
Enclave of water spirits. Free spirits are quite uncommon, but the spirit activity around this spit of rock is undeniable.
