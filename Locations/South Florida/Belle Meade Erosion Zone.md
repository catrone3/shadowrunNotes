Seawalls have gone up in much of the city to fight rising sea levels, but this section of the city's coast was irreparably undermined by the 2050's. The Belle Meade Seawall was erected just to the west to protect the rest of this city, while this area has been left to decay. Smugglers and squatters of all types exploit this neglected strip of the city. Utility services haven't functioned here for decades. What squatters inhabit these ruins live off the grid. Services are almost non-existent.   
  
Population: Fewer than 90,000.  
  
E Rating security. This area is considered a slum. Security will respond if the victim has a SIN and calls in a complaint himself, or if the violence makes the headlines or threatens to spill over into more “important” areas.
