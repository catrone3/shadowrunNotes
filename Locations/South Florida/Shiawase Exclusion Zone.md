For generations locals have known the sound of the emergency broadcast horns set up for many miles around the nuclear power plan located on the coast. During the Hurricane season of 2062 the alarms sounded, and everyone within fifteen miles was ordered to evacuate.  
  
No radiation was detected in the air or water. No obvious signs of an explosion or meltdown were detected. Nothing seemed to happen. The Shiawase corporation maintains the alarms were set off by a power failure during a storm. However, curious reporters, scientists, and explorers who try to enter the zone are rounded up by surprisingly zealous security.Â   
  
In order to keep their assets safe, Shiawase has taken control over this area and forbids any vehicles from deviating from the roads or stopping, but smugglers and coyotes have ways of getting through this area.

## Geographic Notes

#### Hercules Missile Silo

One of several decommissioned short range missile silos that spot the southern coast. Built following the Cuban Missile Crisis these facilities are now mostly consumed by the Everglades, though they have very large footprints of thick cement, deep silos, and rusting buildings.

#### Shiawase Turkey Point Fusion Generating System

The Shiawase corporation owns this state of the art (for 2051) multiple nuclear fusion reactor facility. The company made use of the preexisting fission reactor's cooling facilities, which occupy 13 square kilometers, and claims to have properly disposed of all hazardous materials on site. No need for inspection, thank you.
