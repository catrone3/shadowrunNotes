For generations locals have known the sound of the emergency broadcast horns set up for many miles around the nuclear power plan located on the coast. During the Seven Storms Season of 2061 the alarms sounded, and everyone within fifteen miles was ordered to evacuate.  
  
No radiation was detected in the air or water. No obvious signs of an explosion or meltdown were detected. Nothing seemed to happen. The Shiawase corporation maintains the alarms were set off by a power failure during a storm. However, curious reporters, scientists, and explorers who try to enter the zone are rounded up by surprisingly zealous security.Â   
  
In order to keep their assets safe, Shiawase has taken control over this area and forbids any vehicles from deviating from the roads or stopping, but smugglers and coyotes have ways of getting through this area.
