This region of the beach was badly damaged by the Meistersinger Massacre. It has since been totally rebuilt as an enclave of the privileged of the Caribbean League and various corporate partners in glistening skyrakers that block the view of the sunrise for mainland residents. Heavily patrolled by Knight Errant. Residents live and play here, mostly in secure luxury, though the prestige of the northern end of the island is a bit less than the more famous South Beach.  
  
Population 70,000  
  
Security is rating AA. Patrols cover the area 24 hours a day, but are less frequent than AAA. Astral patrols take place on an irregular schedule, and there may not be a security rigger system set up. Drones and spirits may guard certain areas in place of humans. Response is prompt.

## Geographic Notes

#### Arsenic and Old Lace Mansion

Owned by the most famous fighter in the world, Frank "the Torturer" Lacey. This troll genius used his brawn to become rich and his ruthless acumen to become one of the richest in the world with diverse holdings in several corps. No one knows how far his winnings go, and very few people are willing to try to find out. He owns the entire island, with 17 total mansions, a marina, and a private golf course, all as the playground for one man.
