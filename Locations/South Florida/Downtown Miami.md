Vast skyscrapers from dozens of corporations jostle for space among civic building and business centers. Comparatively few people live here, only wealthy executives can afford the privilege, but huge numbers of people work and visit daily.   
  
Population: 25,000.  
  
Security is rating AA. So many corporate buildings nestle closely here that AAA security is not uncommon, though the various security forces have extremely narrow jurisdictions.

## Geographic Notes

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Ares/Ares Tower|Ares Tower]]
A towering corporate structure, Ares Tower serves as the regional headquarters for Ares Macrotechnology. It houses executive offices, research labs, and manufacturing facilities, showcasing Ares' dominance in the military and security industries.

#### Bayfront Market

The Bayside Marketplace is one of the few remaining holdings of the Gunderson corporation, the company that used to run Miami as a mob town. Everyone who does business here to the constant influx of tourists must pay high rates to the Gunderson corporation. Grifters and pickpockets mingle easily in the crowds.

#### Caribbean League Miami COD Center

The existing Miami government buildings remain intact, as does the local government, but new CL buildings were installed for "Coordination," "Oversight," and "Diplomacy," hence the name. Foreign embassies can also be found here.  
  
Employees here are almost all from elsewhere in the Caribbean and usually work here on stints of only a few years. It's not clear if this is some kind of security policy or if Miami is considered an undesirable post.

#### Cosmonaut Club

This mega-club rises 100 meters into the air. The heavy bass shakes the air for half a kilometer at night. Filled with private rooms, easy sex, illicit drugs, and a party 24-hours a day, it is popular with everyone. One of the few places where megacorp workers, executives, shadowrunners, drones, and tourists gather in one place.  Security ranges from A to AAA.

#### Lofwyr Concert Hall

Newly renovated, fitted with the latest technology, and decorated in the most ornate rococo style this is the premiere concert space in the city.

#### Miami-Dade College

The only option for in person instruction that is remotely affordable for most residents. The student/teacher ratio in most undergraduate courses is 350/1.

#### Miami-Dade Courthouse

This historic courthouse still holds a jail and takes care of all the daily justice issues of the city. There are numerous street vendors, bondsmen, and bounty hunters nearby. The verdigrised copper roof supports scores of vulture nests. The lawyers and judges scrupulously ignore the symbolism.

#### Marquis Luxury Residences

This early 21st century condominium tower has long housed some of the wealthiest and most famous Miami Residents. Its gleaming facade and location north of the central concentration of skyscrapers downtown have long made it a landmark. Once a significant skyscraper, it it now dwarfed by the mid to late 21st century skyrackers in the areas, making it chiefly the residence of the aging once famous who are trapped by the depreciated value of their condo investments.
#### Over-Technica Condominium

Originally housing for high-tech workers, this aging building still maintains the glitz and glamour of its former days. Now a haven for the middle class heart of Miami.   
  
A typical megablock condominium with amenities on lower floors. Some resident essentially never leave.

#### [[../../AAA Corps/Saeder-Krupp/BaryTech Heavy Industries Plant|BaryTech Heavy Industries Plant]]
This massive industrial complex is operated by Saeder-Krupp, producing advanced machinery, vehicles, and military hardware.

#### Saeder-Krupp Pace Towers

Owned by Saeder-Krupp Heavy Industries the world's largest and most powerful megacorp, little is known about what business goes on in the immense tower built here. Despite its abstract design, people say its sweeping glass exterior resembles the folded wings of the Great Dragon Lofwyr looming over the city.

#### Trinity Cathedral

An episcopal Cathedral literally overshadowed by the Corporate buildings around it, church members are allowed access to the compound through a security screening process.

#### University of Miami Medical Center

The premier medical facility in the Caribbean League, some of the wealthiest and most powerful patients in the region are treated here. Security to keep out the "undesirable" elements across the street to the west is airtight. The towering cement barricades mean most patients are easily able to put the poor next door out of the their minds. Like several other health services in the area, this medical facility is owned by the Evo corporation.
