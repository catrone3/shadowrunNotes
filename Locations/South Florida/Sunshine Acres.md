Sunshine Acres was the northernmost and largest of the relief centers built after the Meistersinger Massacre, it was one of the few areas largely unaffected by the event. By the late 2060s the relief centers were being shut down and replaced with more 2 story buildings and what little of the wealthy still existing moving in. By now, this is where all of the wealthy of greater Miami go. The rest are farther north in Pompano or Boca Raton.
  
Population estimated at 200,000.  
  
Rating A area mostly. Law enforcement in these areas is basically a call-and-response system. This means there are actually a lot of PanicButton booths and neighborhood watch groups and other organizations willing to call in at the slightest hint of criminal activity.

A botanical Garden that has a large amount of spirits and awakened critters. The area has a low background count. There is a small fee to enter the garden. If you wish to do any magical research here it will require even more money.
