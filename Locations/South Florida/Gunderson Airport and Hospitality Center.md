Vastly increased traffic and the need for longer runways to support suborbital flights have made the airport grow and consume the surrounding sections of the city.  
Owned by the Gunderson Coproration, which used to own all of South Florida, this is a major hospitality and convention area. Massive hotels, sprawling convention centers, and glamorous entertainment buildings are located here, all leased and operated by varied customers, from independent single owner operations to megacorporations.   
  
Many workers live here full time, trapped in contracts that keep them on site. Residents here  number roughly 20,000.  
  
Overall security is rating AA, but each lease holder runs their own independent security on site. Gunderon's security can't intrude without a clear violation of the lease. The independent security can vary tremendously in quality.
