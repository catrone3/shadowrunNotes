Like many natural barrier islands in Florida in 2075, this island is poorly maintained as it has minor flooding anytime high tide comes in. This has caused all of the wealth houses that used to be here to get sold for dirt cheap or abandoned  
  
This area is rating D. Infrequent patrols and poorly maintained PanicButton booths mean that crime here is reported less often and therefore enforced less often. The security services in these areas make no real effort to prevent crimes before they happen.

## Geographic Notes

#### Bill Baggs Historic Lighthouse

This historic building used to be a minor tourist draw. Now it serves as a way point for smugglers cutting through the bay without electronic navigation.
