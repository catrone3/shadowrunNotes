Anyone who thinks living in the Reef is intolerable and who can't afford to move out or get the right clearances to leave can always hop the wall and make it to Gladeview. This area has never been rebuilt since the Seven Storms season of 2061. Sinkholes have swallowed entire city blocks. Whole buildings have collapsed. Tropical trees overshadow apartment buildings, and strange magical creatures climb onto dilapidated roofs to howl at the moon.   
  
The magical backround in this area varies wildly, and many areas are quite dangerous for the awakened.   
  
Resident population: Unknown.   
  
Security is rating Z. Law enforcement is unlikely to respond to anything which happens here unless it threatens outside areas.
