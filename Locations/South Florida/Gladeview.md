Anyone who thinks living in the Reef is intolerable and who can't afford to move out or get the right clearances to leave can always hop the wall and make it to Gladeview. This area has never been rebuilt since the Meistersinger Massacre. Sinkholes have swallowed entire city blocks. Whole buildings have collapsed. Tropical trees overshadow apartment buildings, and strange magical creatures climb onto dilapidated roofs to howl at the moon.   
  
The magical backround in this area varies wildly, and many areas are quite dangerous for the awakened.   
  
Resident population: Unknown.   
  
Security is rating Z. Law enforcement is unlikely to respond to anything which happens here unless it threatens outside areas.

## Geographic Notes

#### Devil rat Swarms

Periodically swarms of devil rats rush out of Gladeview as through fleeing some greater force, stampeding into homes, businesses, and even traffic. What occasionally terrifies these animals is unknown.

#### Witching Hour Fog

Each night in the wee hours of the morning a thick fog emanates from this area. No one knows why.
