#Athens 
### Location Details
#### Awakened
 - **Free Spirits** - For some reason there's a greater concentration of Free Spirits in and around Athens. Most seem to have been some form of Guidance and Task Spirits, one Task Spirit even opened up shop and works as a highly paid sculptor. I've seen some Task Spirits before and often they take a shape that's practical. These ones are not only humanoid but very anthropomorphic.

-   **Classical Tradition** - Magic in Greece never quite took off the same way as it did in other places. No one liked the idea of praying to Zeus or, ahem, Ares for help. Still, Mentor Spirits claiming to be those ancient Greek deities have shown up to the Awakened Greek, worldwide. The Classicists don't like them. At all. There's the Greek Priesthood, small in number and not really growing, but the Classicists are making sure they stay that way. These guys are historians, or history buffs at least, and they're probably responsible for the higher than average number of Free Spirits (that may or may not be inspired by sculptures or frescoes or whatever). Not big fans of shadowrunners either, but they'll hire you to make sure the _presbyters_ stay down.

-   **Asclepions** - I'm told that back in ancient times these were places of wonder and healing. Spiritual-like. Well today it's the name of a popular chain of street clinics. So far they've managed to remain independent, and their AR overlay in their waiting rooms depict natural Greek scenes with all the pollution edited out. Make sure to buy a medpass since the fees triple for "walk-ins". They don't ask too many questions and will answer the rest themselves if you _donate_ to their cause. They actually do some actual good in the world. No pick-ups though.

-   **Angry Bulls** - How many pissed off Minotaurs do you think you can handle? They have their own name for their street gang, and that is what they are, but they're not inclined to share it. They're angry, they hate everything, and they've carved out their territory amid some ruins (the more recent kind). They like to wear red. Do. Not. Call. Them. Red Bulls. You've been warned.

-   **Satyrs** - I hate to sound racist but don't ever trust a satyr. Nearly all of these guys are Awakened and nearly all of them follow Bacchus. You go look up who that is. Weird thing is that "Bacchus" is the Roman name for Dionysus, the original Greek god for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Why a bunch of Greek Satyrs are worshipping a Roman-inspired totem is beyond me. The Greek Priesthood has ties to Dionysus who may or may not also be Bacchus. If this is getting too metaphilosophical for you then I'm right there with you. But the Satyrs seem to have focused on the darker aspects of Bacchus. Dionysus is apparently more of a social party guy.

-   **Sites of Power** - The reason I know so much is that during my late night walks I stumbled upon a _revel_. Not a party, a shindig, or a soiree. An old fashioned revel. Greece is practically littered with ancient ruins and almost all of these have become or always were sites of power. Mana flows oddly here, but powerfully. It's worth getting acquainted with several sites, otherwise you may cheese off some of the Free Spirits. Anyway, the revel: not all of the participants were willing, conscious, or perhaps even living. I have seen some drek in my time, chummers. This is one of the darkest I've ever seen. Apparently good food and drinks though. Just don't ask what was being served.

-   **Toxics** - While I was running for my life and sanity I ran into a cove just outside the city limits. Athens, and really all of Greece, is unfortunately heavily polluted. Perhaps not much more than any other modern metropolis, but it still sucks. That means Toxic magicians, and boy are there plenty. But you never really encounter them. Back about 20 years ago there was a major Hive that was rooted out. It was just shoved further underground, right where the Toxics were. They've been engaged in their own shadow war since then, mostly keeping the fight to themselves. This cove I ran into was perhaps a Toxic stronghold. It glowed like one and I was about to hightail it outta there when I literally stumbled upon two corpses. You can guess of what.

-   **Religion** - Just stay away from this. The Orthodox and Catholic Church have come to some sort of agreement and are stamping out the paganism of the Greek Priests and their ilk. Each side offers plenty of pay but they come with way too many strings. Of course, the Muslims have joined in as well, though they're on their own side instead of joining up and fighting the pagans.

#### Mundane
-   **Art and Artifacts** - Okay I lied. But this doesn't strictly require being Awakened. The magical relics/artifact craze of yesteryear is still going pretty strong in the FRH. Not everything has to be magical of course, but the most common jobs for the subtle types are the recovery, destruction, replacement or even re-arrangement of artifacts. This means private homes, mansions, arcologies, and so on so the security levels are all over the place. My second last job involved me walking in someone's home, which was unlocked, and nudging a vase three inches (who uses inches?) to the left and rotating it so that a particular image was facing the window. Don't know if it's feng shui or just a really odd prank. You'll still get called into universities and lower-end corp research sites to grab some stuff. Or insert some false data. Very lucrative business here. Make some contacts in the University of Athens and the Hellas College of Thaumaturgy if you want to make your lives easier.
    
-   **Body Sculpting** - Popular with both with chrome or wetware, the Hellans (and some call themselves that) have managed a strange mix between natural and ideal. Marbled limbs or perfectly muscled forms are the norm here for the well-to-do. Extractions are common as well since these are nearly all individualized works of art. For most of these runs the Johnson and the Mark are usually one and the same. Struggling artists sign contracts and no-compete clauses to work for a master and his workshop. When they learn enough or they get sick of their bosses hogging the credit they strike out on their own. Many are actually well-educated, students of biology and anatomy with medical degrees. Worth keeping on your good side.
    
-   **Getting Around** - Public transportation sucks. But all other alternatives are worse. Buy multiple passes, each one tied to a different SIN, and take the trains. Avoid any and all "express" trains. Not because they're horrible, but because they all have so many sensors and cameras that any Fake SINs will be easily caught. The advertising on those is relentless, so many upstanding normal citizens avoid them as well. If you buy a mapsoft that only shows you the streets you got ripped off. Cities build up and there are layers to old ancient Athens that don't show up in the tourist softs.
    
-   **Food** - It's usually fish. If you don't like seafood you should avoid the entire region omae. Sure, it's not caught from the sea anymore, but it's still a big thing. This is where you can do some sorta legitimate work. There are aqua farms near Athens as well as dozens of so-called water purification plants. Most of these are covers or tax loopholes. The FRH can't afford to inspect each and every one of them--the truth is they can but their inspectors have inconvenient attachments to their lives or their loved ones which the corporations are all too willing to eliminate. Recently, they've just been bribing them so the inspectors nearly all work for the corps they're inspecting. That's where you come in. No, you don't blow up the damn fish and krill farms. You familiarize yourself with the environmental codes, or get a knowsoft, and you secretly gather information. Maybe record some frank discussions between employees, or secure some mail from management. This goes beyond the food industry, but it's the biggest concern. They pay well and may get you a contact inside the government for other work.

#### Bunker Tunnels
Beneath the bustling streets of Athens lies a labyrinth of tunnels and bunkers, constructed during World War II to provide shelter from bombing raids. While many of these tunnels have been sealed off or repurposed for modern use, there is one section that remains untouched and mysterious.

Rumors abound of strange noises emanating from the depths of the bunker, and those brave enough to venture inside have reported a feeling of being watched by unseen eyes. It is said that during certain phases of the moon, a shimmering portal opens within the bunker, leading to a realm of otherworldly spirits and ancient powers.

Many runners and magical practitioners seek out this hidden site in hopes of tapping into the mystical energies that flow within its walls. Some believe that it is a nexus of ley lines, a place where the raw power of the earth converges, while others suspect that it is the domain of powerful spirits who have long been forgotten by mortal man.

Regardless of its true nature, the bunker remains a tantalizing mystery, a place where the line between reality and the supernatural blurs, and where brave runners can uncover powerful secrets and ancient treasures, if they're willing to risk the dangers that lurk within.
