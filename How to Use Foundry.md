# How to Use Foundry

We will be playing using the Foundry virtual tabletop platform. Foundry handles all things like sharing handouts and materials, managing digital character sheets, automating dice rolling, and also rendering a map with tokens. The trade-off is that this may not be as intuitive or familiar as straigh discord or, but hopefully this should be a fairly easy learning curve.

This handout is intended to provide a step-by-step guide on how to get started with. We are likely to pick up more of Foundry as we go along.

## Logging In

-   Go to my [Foundry VTT](http://shadowrun.catrone3.com) instance.
-   Log in to the game by selecting your character name from the dropdown menu. Only the GM should require a password, so you should be able to log in fairly easily.
-   If you want to set a password for your user, let me know. I will need to set it manually.

## Selecting a Character

As you log in, there will be a dialogue box that will prompt you to select a character. Select the sheet for your character. This will ensure all the dice rolls show in the chat as coming from the right person. You can configure these settings and release your selected character using the menu in the bottom left corner of the Foundry screen.

## Character Sheets

On the sidebar in the Foundry window, you will see a tab with a person icon called the ‘Actors’ panel. This is where you will find all of the character sheets, and you can click on them to open them.


## Rolling Dice

-   You can roll dice using the `/roll` or `/r` commands. You can use the basic dice syntax to roll specific dice with modifiers, like `/roll 1d20 +5`, etc
-   You can also roll specific skill checks, attacks, saves, spells, et cetera by clicking on the relevant item on your character sheet.
-   You can also set up shortcut macros by dragging and dropping the item, like the weapon or spell, into the macro bar at the bottom of the screen and use the relevant hotkey to use that macro.
