#Denver 
The worldwide headquarters for [[../Spiritech|SpiriTech]], located in Boulder. Due to [[../Spiritech|SpiriTech]]’s large number of employed spirits and shamans, this building has some interesting architecture. [[../Spiritech|SpiriTech]] hired Ming Solutions to provide them with guidance on how to handle the spirit employees’ special needs. The result is a building that has no living material on the sides of the building. This allows spirits to wander in and out at their leisure. Additionally, the building has living material in the walls, which preserves the privacy of those inside the building.
