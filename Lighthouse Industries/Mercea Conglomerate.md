Character Goals
- [[../Players/London/Nightowl|Nightowl]]’s 

	- Recovery of memories of one Adam Henderson, aka [[../Players/London/Nightowl|Nightowl]]. 

	- Recovery of memories in the deceased to avoid necessity of captives who are disagreeable or lost due to misfortune. 

	- Recovery of memories of the unwilling without the use of magic. Preferably covertly. 

	- Alteration of memories to suit our means, including the use of the above method of information gathering if required. 

	- Conditioning and brainwashing, refinement. 

- [[../Players/Old Characters/Elfo|Elfo]]’s 

	- Explore A.I. emergence and its causes. 

	- Discover methods to transfer consciousness between a Metahuman into the Matrix. Faux A.I.? True A.I.? 

	- Create Decker Group for research and personal purposes. 

	- Find or make an A.I. to build our Host. 

- [[../Players/London/Casper|Casper]]’s 

	- Delve further into possibilities of Bio-Rigging. Keep in mind that current technology does not allow for Swarming of Bio-Drones per the Stirrup Interface (Linked in additional notes), probably best to not push for that if Will allows for any human Bio-Rigging of any sort in any timeframe. Avoid the Squirt Gun Conundrum. 

	- Discover ways to allow Riggers to Assense via Drones. Perhaps dig into FAB research? Lantern Thingy? 

- [[../Players/London/Zer0|Zer0]]’s 

	- Entertainment?


Planning Phases:
Step 7: Identify potential rivals locally and otherwise both for recruitment (see poaching) purposes, and to steal supplies as needed. Potentially blatant sabotage to kneecap competition if we cannot buy them out. 

Step 8a: Acquistion of Industrial Park 

Step 8b: Acquistion of Industrial Equipment (Facilities from lifestyles?) 

Step 8c: Acquisition of Drones and Workers (See [[../Players/London/Casper|Casper]] for Drones, see acquisitions for employees) 

Step 9a: Acquistion of Building for Hospital/Delta Clinic 

Step 9b: Acquistion of Medical/Ware Installation Equipment (Facilities from lifestyles for medical? Alternate means likely needed for Delta Clinic level of upgrades) 

Step 9c: Acquisition of Drones and Workers (See [[../Players/London/Casper|Casper]] for Drones, see acquisitions for employees) 

Step 10: Found Magical Group for Shadowrunners/Adept Security team? 

Step 11: Build our own Host and begin to upgrade it alongside aid of [[../Players/Old Characters/Elfo|Elfo]] and Technicolor Streams. Once in the Foundation we can Grow an existing Host: It takes # of Months = Current Rating to raise the Rating value by 1.
