The Sisters of Mercy is an all-female gang that operates as a cult-like organization. Led by a charismatic and mysterious figure known as Mother Mercy, they blend religion, violence, and twisted ideology to further their nefarious goals. The Sisters of Mercy often engage in human trafficking, forced prostitution, and ritualistic activities. Their distinctive black robes and skull masks strike fear into the hearts of those who cross their path.
