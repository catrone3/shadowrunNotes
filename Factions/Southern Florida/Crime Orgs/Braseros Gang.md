#miami
A troll/ork gang that runs a shanty town by the old quarry lakes. Other big troll/ork gangs look up to these guys, who manage to extort protection money from Medley business. More than one innocent bystander has had their hands and feet charred to blackened stumps over coals and then been thrown into deep quarry lakes by these gangers merely for being in the wrong place.
