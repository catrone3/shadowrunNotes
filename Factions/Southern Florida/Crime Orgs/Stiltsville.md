A sprawling island of squatter homes built from driftwood and scavenged homes (not all abandoned) that supports a local "fishing" operation, mostly held above the sea on stilts.Â  Lots of smuggling, piracy, drug manufacturing, bespoke cyberware chop shops and other low quality illicit activities.  
  
Somehow nothing illicit is ever found on raids, as though the locals get advanced notice.
