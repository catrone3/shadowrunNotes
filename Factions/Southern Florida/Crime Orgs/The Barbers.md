They say hard times and hard living make for hard people. Living in a fetid refugee camp for seventeen years has put an edge on this gang of knife nuts. Shunning all guns, they revel in the intimidation factor of their fearless reputation. According to rumor, prospective members must kill 21 people in their first month, or suffer beheading. More likely they simply jump members in with a beating.  
  
Gang members include some cybered up razorboys and razorgirls, a handful of magicians and adepts, and a cadre of archers armed with modern bows.
