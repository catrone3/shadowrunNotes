#miami
An awakened gang that focuses on items they believe are mystical in some way. They are especially obsessed with lunar-themed symbols. They are known to have a network of neighborhood watches to alert them to movement of possible artifacts. They will use this network to help determine when the security around a target is the weakest and strike then. Because of this corps and those in the shadows are more than comfortable with paying them to retrieve an artifact for them.
