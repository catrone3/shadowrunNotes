### Response to player actions'
#### After Serpil Factor Attack
After Serpil basically lost his chemical plant from his fued with Hanno Färber. They took Serpil and put him through the program and he is currently being reprogrammed at their Black Forest site.

#### After Ardat-Lili incident
after loosing the black site at the Ardat-Lili they are looking for who blew up the facility. After a week of evidence gathering, they are no closer to the identity of the person that set the charges than they were at the start. They do know that who ever this is new to the scene of setting explosives off around the area or even the world.

They did have some video footage of attack on the facility, but it is only two faces to go off of. They know that there was at least 5 people and 2 drones, but the camera was not able to see past the magic on 3 of the people. What makes it harder is that one of the people that was seen on the camera's is one of the agents that was abducted by an unknown group. The other was spotted placing the explosives while wearing a mask the entire time. 

They have hired a team to try and located these two members, the runner team is taking advantage of some of their members being trogs and using some of the gangs to keep an eye out for them. 

#### After tracking down the team
The players were lured into what should have been a trap. The players saw the writing on the wall. So they hired another runner team to trigger it. After it was triggered the new runners were captured and taken to a mind reading facility. The players then broke out that runner team. The players took the one taking the notes as well as the notes he had out. 

#### After the rescue of the new runners
The Syndikat is now pissed about the players getting in their way. They have a hit out on the team for 50,000 nuyen to any gang members that manage to kill any of them. The gangers will now be making sure to aim for them. Although the lack of any good description is making it hard for the gangs to actually claim the hit. As of this point, Two Ogres and an elf have died from this.
