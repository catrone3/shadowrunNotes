The Chavez family deals heavily in drugs, prostitution, and gambling. Miguel “Caesar” Chavez sent his son, Omar, to establish a market in Denver some thirty or forty years ago with the goal of sticking it to the Azzies, which he does whenever he gets the chance. They have their prime location of Lakeside Amusement Park and Casino in the CAS thanks to negotiations between Thomas Flying Squirrel and Omar. Miguel Chavez has kept the family strictly human, though he’s not totally biased against metahumans. When Ghostwalker kicked Aztlan out, Omar got into the good graces of his father by taking out a few Aztlan sympathizers and company men once they lost their backing. In the years since, Omar Chavez and the [[Koshari]] formed a non-aggression pact, with the Chavez family giving the [[Koshari]] ten percent of Lakeside’s profits for the next twenty years. I don’t know if Miguel knew or would have approved of those terms, but it kept the Chavez family in business.  

Omar had a saying, “The shadows can be a dangerous place,” and he showed how dangerous they could be by leaving multiple calling cards indicating his displeasure at runners’ failings. In a karmic cycle, Omar met his demise at the hands of a few lucky runners paid off by a rival organization—probably either Yakuza or Triad. The Denver base of operations was shaken heavily with the death of Omar Chavez (1977–2071) and subsequent power plays by rival organizations. 

> The Lakeside Amusement Park and Casino is a good place if you want a private conversation or if you’re looking to set up an exchange. The park is loud and crowded with many tag erasers, white noise generators, and other surveillance countermeasures installed by Chavez security.

Mr. Ruocco, who runs the casino, has managed to establish a network of smugglers and T-bird jockeys to import fresh meat and fi sh to the casino. It’s not that meat and fi sh are illegal, but bypassing the taxes and tariffs is. If you’ve got refrigeration in your hold and a fast vehicle, then Ruocco wants you.

A big surprise to everyone, including Miguel, was that instead of Omar’s older son Emilio taking over his father’s territory and becoming the new sotto capo, Emilio’s younger brother Carlos staged his own reorganization. Yes, Emilio was a hothead and a disappointment to his father, but the rotten apple really didn’t fall too far from the Chavez tree. Carlos tried to kill his brother, blaming Emilio for their father’s death, but Emilio escaped in the firefight.

It didn’t take long for Don Chavez to become involved in restoring order. Two of the five capos were dead, however, along with a dozen soldatos, before Joseph Lovato, Miguel’s right-hand man, arrived. Don Chavez was already en route to see his son when Omar was assassinated. To reduce animosity, he had the rest of the capos transferred to Dallas and a more neutral group brought in. Unfortunately, in the weeks it took for Joseph to restore order, the other syndicates smelled blood in the water and muscled in on the Chavez territory. There was one saving grace: the [[Koshari]] pact. With the [[Koshari]] pact, the Chavez family had a bit of a buffer zone with the [[Koshari]] staying neutral in their civil war and the mob war with the other organizations.

With the reorganization, the internal conflict became more subtle. Carlos brought in Mario “Tornado” Platte to check up on the loyalty of the family members. A gifted hacker, Tornado was recently recruited by the Chavez family when the sotto capo got tired of the [[Casquilho family]] knowing more about what was going on around Denver, and within his own organization, than he did. Tornado does very good work as a spider, patrolling the network of nodes controlled by the family. Carlos also has him intercepting communications, checking for any sympathy for Emilio. Two of the likeliest suspects are Hector “Torque” Casey and associate Erik Fjordson. Both were/are close to Emilio, and Erik has been rumored to provide drones to them from the company MetalStorm.
