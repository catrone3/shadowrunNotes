When quickening a spell you can keep all of the successes you roll per normal rules (recommended for resisting dispelling), however you can only use a maximum net of caster’s magic successes or +4 to any attribute whichever is higher. This means that increased reflexes caps out at +magic +5d6. Another example is analyze device, you can keep up to the caster’s magic net successes after the object resistance role. Because of the +4 part of this rule, growth can keep up to 12 net successes

Quickened spells must now be set up using the buy your hits method. You are only allowed to have a number of spells quickened up to your initiate grade. And you must pay the karma cost equal to the number of hits you have on the spell**
