Binding. This spell coalesces fog from the surrounding air and the caster may bind a maleficent spirit to a willing target within this fog when the spell is cast. The magician blows openly into the air and makes a Spellcasting test against target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the target gains +3 to close combat Attack and Damage tests, and Physical Defense for the duration of the spell. During this time, the spirit will urge them to attack the nearest target each round with the exception of spirits and undead. If they wish to resist this urge, they can make a Willpower test against the spirit’s Social Defense (12).

If they successfully resist the compulsion or if they attack any spirits or undead, the spell will end and the bound spirit will immediately depart (though possibly hold ing a grudge against the offender) and this spell and Summon Fog Ghost may not be cast for a full day. This spell may only have one active casting at a time (including Summon Fog Ghost).

This spell may be stored in the same spell matrix as Summon Fog Ghost.
