*Water–Cold*. This spell coats a weapon with a layer of inky frost pulled directly from astral space. The magician exhales into his clenched fist and makes a Threading test against the Weapon's Object Resistance. If successful, shadowy tendrils of freezing fog swirl out of his fist and envelop the weapon. The wielder adds net hits to the weapon’s Damage test and any target that takes damage from the weapon suffers a -2 penalty to Defense Tests until the end of the next round. The spell can be cast on weapons made from any material—wood, metal, bone, and so on.
