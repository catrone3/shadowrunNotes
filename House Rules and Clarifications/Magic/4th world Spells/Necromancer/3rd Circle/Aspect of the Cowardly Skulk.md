Binding. This spell summons a spirit of shadow and temporarily binds it to a willing target. The magician reaches into his own shadow and draws out handful of an inky black substance which he then proceeds to smear on the target and makes a Threading test against the targetâ€™s Willpower + Intuition. If successful, the spirit materializes over the target and merges with him. The target immediately drops into a crouch and takes on a squirrel-like demeanor.

The target of the spell gains a +4 bonus to Perception-based tests to gain information from direct observation and Sneak tests to escape detection.

The target may also move at full speed while avoiding detection. Any active threats against the target cause him to immediately flee at his fastest movement to safety, after which this spell immediately ends and the target must flee from any threats for the next hour. This spell may only have one active casting at a time.
