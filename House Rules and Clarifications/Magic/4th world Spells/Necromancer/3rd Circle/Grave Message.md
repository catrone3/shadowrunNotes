This spell magically sends a message to another Namegiver. The magician speaks a message no longer than fifty words inside a Bone Circle (p. 318), a cemetery, or a place where spirits are active, then makes a Threading (6) test. If successful, the message is successfully sent to a specific bone circle, cemetery, or place in which spirits are active, and addressed to a Named character or “any <insert description> who happens by.” The message is spoken to the target in a quavering spirit voice only once.
