Manipulation Spell
Type:  Mental
Range: LOS Area
Duration: S
Drain: F-3

This spell conjures a mist that causes fear in those wrapped in its misty tendrils. The magician wraps his arms about himself as if cold, points to where the fog will appear and makes a Threading test. If successful, a luminous, wispy-gray and cold fog coalesces into a Force meter radius sphere around the position. Once conjured, the fog cannot move. The magician may use the Fear power against all targets within the affected area as a single action, causing his menacing visage to appear formed from the substance of the fog.
