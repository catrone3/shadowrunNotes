Illusion Spell
Type:  Mental
Range: T
Duration: S
Drain: F-6

The magician makes stabbing motions with his hands and makes a Threading test. If successful, the target is racked with crippling waves of agony. The effect of this spell causes the target net hit boxes of damage and his Movement Rate is halved for the duration of the spell. The spell has no effect on creatures that don’t feel pain or are used to or inured against it. This includes undead, most Horrors and Horror constructs, and blood elves.

If used against cadaver men (see the Gamemaster’s Guide) it immediately sends them into a frenzy.
