Manipulation Spell
Type:  Physical
Range: T
Duration: Special
Drain: F-6

This spell covers an arrow with a chilling sheath of darkness, forming a silhouette. The arrow must be fired within one round of the spell being cast or the enchantment is lost. The magician wraps his hand around the head of the arrow and makes a Threading test. Darkness drawn from astral space wraps itself around the arrow and adds a bonus to the missileâ€™s Damage test equal to Force.

If the target suffers damage from the spell, they suffer a -2 penalty to their Mystic Armor until the end of the next round. Handling the shaft causes 1 Stun to the character who fires it. The arrow is consumed by the spell, crumbling to dust the round after it strikes. The spell also works on any solid projectile, including bullets, missiles, crossbow bolts, sling stones or bolts, and blowpipe darts.
