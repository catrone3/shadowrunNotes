_Binding_. This spell summons the bone spirit from one of the magician’s Bone Circles within Spellcasting rank x10 miles, binding the bone spirit to a willing target. The magician takes two bones and throws one on the ground, stomping on it, touches the target with the other and makes a Threading test against the target’s Willpower+Intuition. If successful, the bone spirit materializes and melds with the target. The target’s appearance becomes pale and faded, their bones significantly more prominent. The target gains +4 to Mystic Defense and Mystic Armor.

For the duration of the spell, If the target fails to obey any of the caster’s commands, the spell immediately ends. If the spell ends prematurely, that Bone Spirit may not be summoned or bound again for a full day.
