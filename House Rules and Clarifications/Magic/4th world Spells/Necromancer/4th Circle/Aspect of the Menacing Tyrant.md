_Binding_. This spell summons a spirit of terror and temporarily binds it to a willing target. The magician touches and kneels before the target and makes a Threading test against the target’s Willpower+Intuition. If successful, the spirit materializes over the target and merges with him. The target’s posture immediately becomes rigid and all movements forceful. His features sharpen, eyes gleam with otherworldly cruelty and shadows cling to him.

While this spell is active, all gamemaster characters are treated as having a Neutral attitude towards the target. The target gains a +6 bonus to tests based on intimidation and fear. When the duration ends, any attitude of any gamemaster character the target applied the benefit to decreases by one level.

Any actions by the target which directly aid anyone other than the bound character (such as healing them, or even opening a door) cause the spell to end immediately. If the target does not use the granted benefits, or the spell ends prematurely the spell cannot be cast again for a full day and the target suffers a -3 penalty to Willpower-based tests until they have a full nights rest. This spell may only have one active casting at a time.

This spell can be very addictive, as the feeling of power it grants is a heady rush. At the gamemaster’s discretion, the spirit may attempt to remain bound to the target when the duration is over. To expel a reluctant spirit, the character must succeed at a Willpower+Intuition test against the Force of the spell. This test may be attempted at each duration interval (Rank minutes).
