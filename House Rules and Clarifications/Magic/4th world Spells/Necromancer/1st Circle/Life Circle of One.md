Effect: WIL + 2/Mystic

This spell creates a magical circle to repel undead, Horrors, or Horror constructs. The magician spits into his hand, then outlines a 4-yard radius circle with his fingers and makes a Spellcasting (6) test. If successful, the circle resists any undead, Horror, or Horror construct attempting to enter. The magician makes a Spellcasting test against the entity’s Mystic Defense.

If successful, the circle repels and harms the entity. The Effect test determines how much damage is inflicted on the entity.

The spell can only repel a single entity each round. Multiple enemies can easily swamp the circle if they surround it. Should more than one entity enter, the circle will attempt to repel the being with the highest Mystic Defense. Given sufficient preparation time, a magician may cast multiple life circles inside each other, creating concentric circles to protect those standing in the innermost one and affording some protection from multiple entities for a few minutes.
