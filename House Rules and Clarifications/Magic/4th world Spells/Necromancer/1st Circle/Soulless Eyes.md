Effect: +3 to Intimidation tests

This spell enhances the ability to intimidate others. Traditionally it gives the target’s eyes a cruel cast that makes viewers have no doubt about what they are willing to do, though it manifests in different fashions for some magicians. The magician glares and smiles cruelly, then places his hand on the target and makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the target gains a +3 bonus to any Intimidation tests made for the duration of the spell.

Success Levels: Increase Duration (+2 minutes).
Extra Threads: Increase Duration (+2 minutes), Increase Effect (+2 bonus)
