This spell attacks a character with a small dart shaped from astral energy. The magician pinches himself and flicks his wrist as if throwing a dart, then makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the Effect test determines how much damage is inflicted. After damage is inflicted, the target’s Mystic Armor is reduced by 2 until the end of the next round. 

Success Levels: Increase Duration (+2 rounds)
