Duration: Rank minutes
Effect:  + 4 to Stealthy Stride tests

This spell allows a character to become virtually invisible in the shadows. The magician makes a Spellcasting Test against the target’s Mystic Defense.

If successful, the target gains a +4 bonus to all Stealthy Stride tests while near shadows for the duration of the spell and may use Stealthy Stride as a default skill if they do not possess it. Though the target can still be seen normally in light, the presence of light does not end the spell—the target becomes near-invisible again by simply stepping back into a shadow.

Success Levels: Increase Duration (+2 minutes)
Extra Threads: Increase Duration (+2 minutes), Increase Effect (+2 bonus)
