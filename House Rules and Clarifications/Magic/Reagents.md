There is a new taint scale, it goes from -100 to 100. With 100 being toxic mage and -100 being the purist mage possible. Every week, your value changes towards 0 by 1. This means that if you have a taint of 5 then after 5 weeks of not using them you will be at zero. The same would be for if you were at -5.
