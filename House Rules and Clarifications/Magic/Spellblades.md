Both Powerblade and Manablade most closely resemble Indirect spells (damage equals Force + net hits, has a standard Defense Test, can be used to attack an enemy while blindfolded or with artificial image enhancement, etc.).Â 

When attacking with a Powerblade, the damage after the defense test is resisted by Body + Armor.

When attacking with a Manablade, the damage after the defense test is resisted by Willpower.
