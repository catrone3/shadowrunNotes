Alternate Rules for Ritual Magic

Instead of using a standard teamwork test for Ritual Magic use the following alternate rules. The Ritual Leader contributes their entire Magic + Ritual Magic dice pool to the Ritual, each additional participant (a number up to x2 the leader's Magic rating) contributes directly to the ritual's dice pool according to the following chart. Additional participants must have a Magic attribute and know at least 1 rank of the Ritual Magic skill but do not have to be a mage (they can be mystic adepts or adepts and still help). A participant using Greater Ritual does not contribute any dice to the ritual but increases the effective Force as normal. The rules for limit, drain, and reagents remain unchanged.

Dice bonus = to (magic+ritual magic)/4 rounded down
-1 Dice Participant is a different tradition than the leader 
+1 Dice Participant is the same tradition as the leader 
+1 Dice Participant also knows the Ritual being cast
