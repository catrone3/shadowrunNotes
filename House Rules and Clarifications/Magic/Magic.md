## Base rule changes

Look at spells with the search power

Quickened spells are only fully suppressed in background counts. 

Initiation takes only days for the extended test on it

Search - masking roll adds to the threshold

Fear power:
- The changes to the Fear power are as follows
- On your turn, you can choose to do an action, and any action facing the sorce of the fear gives a negative dice pool penalty equal to the critter's net hits.


### Clarifications

- Perception to see what is there in the astral, Assensing to actually get info on what you see
- Counterspelling lasts the turn
- Detection Spells can change targets with a simple action. You just roll the targets resistance when you do so
- Movement works like it does on a person with vehicles
- Noticing magic is a Simple Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test with a threshold equal to the Skill Rating of the being performing it minus the Force of the magic, or 6 – Force if there’s no skill involved (minimum 1 in either case).
- Illusion spells are pass/fail unless otherwise stated.
	- The exceptions are house rules on the Invisiblity spells and sound barrier that provide a negative to the perception test.
