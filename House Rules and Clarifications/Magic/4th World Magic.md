Requires magic 10/grade 8
Uses Threadweaving+magic


-------

**Curt’s Version:

Uses Threadweaving+Magic[Astral]

Rules Notes:
Resist with Intuition on things that reference Mystic Defense / Physical resists using Agility
Damage is a damage dice pool vs appropriate defence
Drain is based off circle of spell using the equation ( (Circle)+(Circle-4) )
Perceiving Magic: use circle of the spell in place of force

Spell Threading (Matrix Creation) - Spell threading is the act of weaving magic till the spell matrices are finished.  When weaving a spell make a special extended Threadweaving+magic[astral] with a threshold based on the circle of spell.  (Table below).  Once successful the spell matrices are created and the spell can be cast as a complex action the pass following the completion.  A spell metrix lasts for 5 minutes per rank in Threadweaving and a magician may only have one spell matrix threatened at any one time.  The number of net successes required is equal to the number of threads required to initiate the spell plus the number of additional threads. 
| Circle | difficulty |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 1-2   | 2                  |
| 3-4   | 3                  |
| 5-6   | 4                  |
| 7-8 | 5                  |

Additional Threads:  Before starting on creating a spell matrix the magician may attempt to add additional threads to a spell to increase it’s effect.  The number of additional threads that can be attached are based on the magicians rank in Threadweaving table below.  The effect of weaving additional threads is dependant upon the spell.

| Rank  | Additional Threads |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 1-3   | 1                  |
| 4-6   | 2                  |
| 7-9   | 3                  |
| 10-12 | 4                  |

Spell Threading (Casting) - Once the spell Matrix is complete the spell is cast with a simple Threadweaving+Magic(Astral) test vs the appropriate stat as determined by the spell.  Net successes may be spent on the spells success levels.**
