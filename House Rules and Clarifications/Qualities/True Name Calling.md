#HouseRules 
30 Karma

This quality can only be taken if your GM approves and is highly recommended that there is lore and story about how it is learned as Dragons are some of the few creatures that know how to do this. This quality can also only be taken after character creation, so the double karma does not apply. A character with this quality knows how to use the power of True Names, this does not grant them the ability to figure out a person or creature's True Name though. When a character tries to use the True Name for power, a Ritual Spellcasting+Magic vs the target's Willpower+Intuition (Combat Turn). If successful the character can force the target to do one action of their choosing. These actions can cause the target to harm themselves, they are aware of what is happening and unless they glitch know who controlled them as it must be a spoken command.


To learn the True name
extended assenssing with a threshold equal to 2 times the targets (magic + essence) 30 min. Followed by a arcana roll with a threshold of the number of rolls on the extended test 1 min. limits on both is force of lodge or astral limit
