Manipulation Spell (Spirit Binding)
Type:  Physical
Range: T
Duration: S
Drain: F-3

Binding. This spell coalesces fog from the surrounding air and the caster may bind a maleficent spirit to a willing target within this fog when the spell is cast. The magician blows openly into the air and makes a Threading test against target. If successful, the target gains a bonus to close combat Attack and Damage tests, and Physical Defense equal to the Force for the duration of the spell. During this time, the spirit will urge them to attack the nearest target each round with the exception of spirits and undead. If they wish to resist this urge, they can make a Willpower test against the spiritâ€™s Social Defense (12).

If they successfully resist the compulsion or if they attack any spirits or undead, the spell will end and the bound spirit will immediately depart (though possibly holding a grudge against the offender) and this spell and Summon Fog Ghost may not be cast for a full day. This spell may only have one active casting at a time (including Summon Fog Ghost).
