_Summoning_. This spell coalesces fog from the surrounding air and coaxes a maleficent spirit to inhabit it. The magician blows openly into the air and makes a Threading test against the spirit’s summoning resist (see below); the magician may choose a lower effective Circle for the spell effect. If successful, the fog ghost appears where the magician wishes within the spell’s range, whereupon it immediately attacks the nearest character (even the magician himself). Each round, the fog ghost indiscriminately attacks whoever is nearest to it using the Effect Step for Attack and Damage tests until it is destroyed or the spell ends.

The fog is nearly impervious to physical attacks. To successfully disrupt the pattern, a character must inflict damage in a single attack equal to or greater than the Effect Step. Destroying the fog does not harm the spirit, which simply returns to its netherworld and waits for another chance to harm the living.

A fog ghost will not attack undead or other spirits. The spell cannot be cast in desert or other very dry environments, nor can it be cast when the temperature is below freezing. This spell may only have one active casting at a time (including Aspect of the Fog Ghost).
