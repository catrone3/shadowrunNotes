_Waterâ€“Cold_. This spell creates a circle of icy mist. The magician spins round in a circle, then suddenly stops to kneel, touches the ground and makes a Threading test against the highest Mystic Defense of all characters inside the area of effect. If successful, an eerie rune unique to the magician appears on the ground and a cloud of freezing mist rises from the glowing shape. All characters, except the caster, take Force +4 damage each round and their Movement Rate is halved while they are in the circle.
