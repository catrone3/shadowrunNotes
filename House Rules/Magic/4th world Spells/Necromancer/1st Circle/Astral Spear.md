This spell weaves energy from astral space to form a phantom spear. The magician pulls his arm back, then hurls it forward as if throwing a spear and makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, an ethereal spear forms that crosses the distance between the two adversaries and strikes the target. The magician’s Effect test determines how much damage is inflicted.
