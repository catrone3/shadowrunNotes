Illusion Spell
Type:  Physical
Range: T
Duration: S
Drain: F-3

This spell allows a character to become virtually invisible in the shadows. The magician makes a Threading Test.

If successful, the target gains a bonus to all Sneak tests while near shadows equal to the net successes for the duration of the spell. Though the target can still be seen normally in light, the presence of light does not end the spellâ€”the target becomes near-invisible again by simply stepping back into a shadow.
