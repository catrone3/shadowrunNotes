Manipulation Spell
Type:  Mental, Area
Range: T
Duration: S
Drain: F-3

This spell draws a piece of darkness from another dimension. The magician cups his hands together, then touches the target character, object or location, commands the darkness to billow forth, and makes a Threading test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the darkness summoned expands to fill a Force meter radius sphere, centered on the target.

The darkness extinguishes all light, causing those within the area of effect to suffer a Total Darkness penalty to sight-based Action tests. Ordinary light does not penetrate Ethereal Darkness. Those with knowledge of Nethermancy are unaffected by Ethereal Darkness—they can see normally, as if the spell had never been cast
