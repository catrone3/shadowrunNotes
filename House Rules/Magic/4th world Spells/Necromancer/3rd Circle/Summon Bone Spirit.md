_Summoning_. This spell summons the bone spirit from one of the magician’s bone circles (p. 318) within Threading rank x10 miles, allowing the spirit to exist outside the circle for a brief period. The magician takes two bones and throws one on the ground, stomping on it, then brandishes the other and makes a Threading test against the bone spirit’s Force. If successful, the bone spirit appears before him. The bone spirit cannot move more than 10 meters from the magician. If it is forced to do so, the spell ends and the spirit returns to its bone circle.

The bone spirit obeys any command the magician gives it—entering combat, reporting happenings within sight of its bone circle, and so on. Bone spirits do not enjoy leaving their circles, so they resist frequent summoning attempts. Each additional attempt to summon the same bone spirit within a day requires an additional success. The bone spirit returns to its circle when the spell ends. If the spirit is destroyed in combat, its bone circle is also destroyed.
