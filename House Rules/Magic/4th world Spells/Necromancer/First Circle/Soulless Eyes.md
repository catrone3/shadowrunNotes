Manipulation Spell
Type:  Physical
Range: T

This spell enhances the ability to intimidate others. Traditionally it gives the targetâ€™s eyes a cruel cast that makes viewers have no doubt about what they are willing to do, though it manifests in different fashions for some magicians. The magician glares and smiles cruelly, then places his hand on the target and makes a Threading test. If successful, the target gains a bonus to any Intimidation tests made for the duration of the spell equal to net hits.
