This spell enhances a character’s Mystic Armor. The magician draws jagged blue sigils of protection in the air and makes a Threading test against the target’s Magical Defense. If successful, a glimmering suit of blue chain mail appears, momentarily covering the target before it sinks into his body. The target adds net hits of the caster to his Mystic Armor. This spell must be resisted
