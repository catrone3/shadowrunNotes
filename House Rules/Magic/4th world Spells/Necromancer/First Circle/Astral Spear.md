This spell weaves energy from astral space to form a phantom spear. The magician pulls his arm back, then hurls it forward as if throwing a spear and makes a Spellcasting test against the targetâ€™s Astral Defense. If successful, an ethereal spear forms that crosses the distance between the two adversaries and strikes the target.
