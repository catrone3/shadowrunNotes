Curtis ideas:

Mystic Defense = intuition (+counterspelling)
Mystic (for effect) = intuition
Keep 1 prepared for rank x 5 minutes
Weaving is threshold for Threading Test

| Rank  | Additional Threads |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 1-3   | 1                  |
| 4-6   | 2                  |
| 7-9   | 3                  |
| 10-12 | 4                  |
